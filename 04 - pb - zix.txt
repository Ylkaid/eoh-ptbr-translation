(21136)At the end of the 19th century, there lived a British aristocrat named Jonathan Joestar...
In order to defeat Dio, who had turned into a vampire,
Jonathan teamed up with his sworn friend Speedwagon and the Hamon master Zeppeli, and threw himself into a fight against the undead.
This is the story of the destiny that Jonathan and Dio shared, and their battle for the stone mask.
This is where it all began...
Are we...inside a building? This doesn't look Japanese...
Whaaaat?!
(What the hell was that?)
Seems like...I wasn't damaged...
(Huh... Where are we?)
What?
(panting)
Hm?! That's...
Mr Joestar!
Mr Joestar! You're alive!?
Speedwagon!?
Keep back! You mustn't get any closer.
Urgh!
Y-you! It's Dio!!
Nnnn?!
I know you... You're that maggot named Speedwagon...
(So this is how DIO looked back then...)
(And that man must be my ancestor, Jonathan Joestar...)
The other one is a fresh face, though. Not as if it matters, though...JoJooo!
Allow me to commend you! You've held out well against all of my spectres of the night.
But my supply of zombies is inexhaustible! There are still plenty more to come!
Ggh! I have to keep my Hamon breathing steady...
Mr Joestar, this is bad... All this battling has left you exhausted...
Charge, zombieees! Make him scream out a fanfare for you!
No! I won't let this happen!
You! You're one of the allies that Speedwagon found, right?
I'll introduce myself later.
Feed on his flesh! Suck up the marrow of his bones!
I've got to get my breathing under control... My Hamon breathing!
JoJo! Give up your struggle and become a part of my life force!
Gimme a break... I'm so sick of fighting moving corpses...
Zombies! What are you doing!? Hurry up and finish him off!
Things will never end at this rate... Bring out the boss already!
What kind of ability is that? You seem to be overflowing with energy! I sense an overwhelming power from you!
Goodbye, JoJooo!
This is my era! This building is...Mr Joestar's...

What?!
He's ploughing through the zombies as if they were made of paper...
Where did you get that...ability?
What's wrong? Looks like you're having some trouble here.
Huh...?
!!
Who's that? It looks like Dio, but...
Tch... Diego Brando?
Diego Brando?! Are you Dio's...big brother?
Heh. I guess that's the limit of people's creativity in this era.
Hey. Enough with the small talk!
Who said you were in charge? We're equals. That was the deal, right?
...
...
Hmph! So be it. I'll deal with you later...
My first priority is to put an end to JoJo!
JoJo... So he's this world's Johnny Joestar...
Huh? What are you blathering about?
...
Okay, I'll lend a hand. How about we team up and take them out together?
Mr Joestar is too exhausted! We'll have to fight in his place!
Don't fail me now, monster...
You're the monster, you miserable excuse for a human...
Dinosaurs were the monsters who controlled our world in ancient times.
No one can slip past their kinetic vision!
KWAHHH! I'll suck up your life force!
In place of your life force, your arteries will be pumping with my vampiric essence!
MUDA MUDAAAAAA!
Weak! So weaaak! My zombies will eat off your pale little faces!
To think that there would come a day when I, Dio, would be made to kneel to mere humans! Y...You'll pay for this! Nnngggh...
Don't think you've won this!
One day! I'll get every last one of you! I'll cut you all up and make you into a feast for my zombies!
Hey, are you two also working for the Noble One?
Are you out of your mind? Our alliance is only temporary.
One day, I'll finish Dio off once and for all... And the same goes for you.
In the end, I, Diego, shall claim total victory!
What...?
Dammit! He ran away!
Urrrgghhh...
Mr Joestar! Are you alright?!
I let the Holy Corpse guide me and gathered allies, just like you told me to!
Speedwagon, now that you mention it, I don't think you've told us anything about yourself yet.
How is it that the Holy Corpse is guiding you?
...
Mr Joestar's compatriots and I intended to make way for
a small town called Wind Knight's Lot.
We'd heard that after turning into a vampire, Dio had been hiding out there, you see.
But just before we could get there, the anomalies appeared in our age!
The Joestar Residence, which burned to the ground in a fire, was suddenly resurrected and became swarming with zombies!
This thing first appeared at Mr Joestar's place...
However, Mr Joestar stayed back to fend off the zombies,
and I wanted to stay with him and fight too, of course,
but he handed me the Holy Corpse part, and told me to travel around the other ages to collect the rest of it.
Thank you...Speedwagon. I'm fine now.
Hamon is life energy. If I can just get my breathing under control, then I can restore a good bit of my stamina.
Mr Joestar, I'm sorry it took so long to bring help.
I was really in danger back there, but you saved me.
Thank you for saving my life. My name is Jonathan Joestar.
Who are you?
...
Jotaro Kujo...
O-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!
Nnnn?!
Jotaro Kujo, Jonathan Joestar, and the corpse guide, Speedwagon...
I'm going to execute you all right here!
Who the hell are you?
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this the first time we've met?
I'm one of The Nine Egyptian Gods... Mariah, of Bastet!
The Nine Egyptian Gods? You're one of N'doul's allies?
If you want to fight, then I'll take you on.
Tee hee...
Is that... No way!
You've already fallen into Bastet's trap!
Anyone who touches my Stand becomes imbued with a strong magnetic force that grows stronger and stronger as time passes...
There's no escaping now!
Get close to Mariah!
The magnetic force will just keep on increasing...
Until eventually it wrenches your body apart...
The power of my Bastet is already...
far greater than your Star Platinum!!
So your Stand can control magnetic force... Pretty cool.
Still, you've got some nerve to come here and take us on all alone.
...
Hoh-hoh-hoh! All alone?
JoJo! You will pay for putting Hamon to ill use!
Zeppeli...?!
Who...?
Mr Joestar's mentor... A Hamon master!
Anyone who defies the Noble One is too foolish to be redeemed! I should have never taught you about Hamon in the first place!
I can't believe it! Mr Zeppeli! You're being affected by an anomaly too?!
Mr Joestar! You can't fight in that state!
No...I must. I have to wake Mr Zeppeli up!
Gimme a break...
Mr Zeppeli! I'm going to go all-out!
Catching her is going to be the hard part...
It's a master's duty to see that his disciples' errors are set straight! Bring it on!
The magnetic force will keep getting stronger and stronger... Until it splats you like a pancake, Jotaro!
In order to erase his Hamon, I need to hit it with another large Hamon blast!
The only thing that's going to be erased here is you, JoJo!
I get it. Your trick is to maintain a steady distance through the battle...
Tee hee... Too bad it took you so long to figure out...
What's wrong? You two done already?
Mr Zeppeli, I trust you. That's why I've given this battle my all...
There's nothing so pitiable as an unworthy disciple... At least I can put you to rest with my own hand!
You two looked pretty handsome out there.
Gfffh!
I see your skills have improved a great deal... Impressive!
But next time we meet, I'll end this once and for all!
Ggh! Ggggh! How dare you...
You're going to regret this, you...tiny little turds!
Mr Zeppeli, please wait!
They're gone...
I'll bring you back to normal, Mr Zeppeli... I promise...
Mr Joestar...
I want you to take this.
I've taken care of it up until now, but it belongs to you!
Speedwagon...
Urgh...
Mr Joestar! Are you okay?!
Sorry. Seems I'm a bit tired...
And no wonder! You've been holding out on your own all this time!
Jotaro, bring out the turtle! We'll have him take a rest inside.
So, have you collected all the corpse parts, Jotaro?
What is it, Gramps?
I was enjoying the sofa in there when Speedwagon came and kicked me out.
"We need to let Mr Joestar rest," he said.
I'm a Mr Joestar too, you know!
Gimme a break.(21305)
