(22247)Morioh Town, Momoji District, S City, Japan -Present Day-
Near the Wall Eyes, the protuberances that suddenly appeared in town,
a strange young man with a star-shaped birthmark on his shoulder was discovered in the ground.
All his memories were lost to him, including his own name.
He was given the name Josuke Higashikata, and was allowed to live in the home of his new guardians until he could find the truth about his origins.
This is a story about dispelling a curse - for curses must be dispelled.
Is this...
Somebody's garden?
I thought we were gonna get flung somewhere crazy, but it's just a plain old Japanese house!
Wait. Mr Joestar?
He isn't here. Did he go somewhere else?
Woah...
Dammit, Josuke!
Don't get cocky now and act like you're smarter than me!
If you even think that you 'beat me,' I'll kill you!
...
I don't even know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about Shakedown Road!
Look, I'm not sure what happened back there, but you discovered some way to get out of that mess, didn't you?!
You used some dirty trick, didn't you?
And now look at you, all cool and collected! Man it pisses me off!
?
Hey, Joshu. What is that?
Don't change the subject!
Just look over there! It's coming at us!
Wh...
Wh-what...is that?
Joshu!
Eeeek! H-Help me!
Gyaaaaaah!
What is this? What's going on?
Aw crap!
Who're you? Are you the one behind this?
Soft & Wet!!
You're a Stand User? Wait, I'm not your enemy!
I just came here looking for parts of the Holy Corpse...
...But I guess that makes no sense to you. Hmmm, how should I put it?
What? The Holy Corpse?!
It did make sense to you?!
All I know about the corpse is what some old man on Shakedown Road told me...
You...
piss me ooooff!
Joshu?
Just strolling on into someone's house like you own the place?
I'm gonna beat you to death!
So...he really is a Stand User!
This is just like with Okuyasu and Shigechi!
All along I thought I understood what was going on, even though I didn't really get it at all...
But maybe that's what's causing the anomalies!
Well, the details can wait. First we need to quiet that guy down!
What's his ability?
Don't know. This is the first time I've seen it too...
Now listen up! Yasuho is miiiiiine!!
She's my woman! I'll never let you have herrrr!
What does she even have to do with this!?
Yasuho even lets me give her kisses! Deep, hoooot ones!
...How can you say something so stupid with such a straight face?
This guy's giving me bad vibes... My instincts are telling me to steer clear from him.
Joshu... So this is your ability...
RERORERORERORERO!

Bleugh...
Okay, now he's all ours. I can only mimic what I saw, but I think if I use the corpse part...
Urgggh...
I-I... Huh?
Back to normal now, Joshu?
Hm?
What are you glaring at me for, huh!? You want me to beat the crap outta you!?
DORAA!
Gyaaahh!!
Hey! What're you doing?!
Huh? He looked like he wasn't recovered yet, so I just hit him again...
...
Fair enough.
Should we shine the light on him one more time?
That's the Holy Corpse...
Tell me what you know about this.
...And that's how it is.
...
I don't think anyone would believe that... It sounds like pure insanity.
But this Holy Corpse may be an important clue to help me learn about myself.
Okay. I'll go with you.
I'll be counting on you.
Hmm?
Do you...have other family members?
Yeah. None of them are home, though, aside from me and Joshu. Why?
Nah... It just felt like someone was hiding over there.
LOOK OVER HEEERE!
Wh-What is that? Something's coming...
...
What? YOU?!
Watch out! That's an explosive Stand! If he touches you, he'll blow up!
Explosive? He's charging right for us!
Go...Heart Attack!
Attack Yoshikage Kira and damage him!
Gggh!!
LOOK OVER HEEERE!
Shining Diamond! Heal him!
Hoo...
I couldn't believe it at first, but you're actually capable of forcing my Heart Attack back...
Josuke Higashikata. To think I'd run into you again in this world...
Imagine the depths of my misery...
Give it a rest! What are you even doing here?!
Yoshikage Kira!
What?!
Indeed... I feel the hand of destiny at work here.
Wha- Who-
Are there...two Yoshikage Kiras?
Two? What are you saying?
I thought this world's Morioh would be a decent place to live, like ours, but...
Of all things, you had to show up...
I don't know if an anomaly is causing this or what...
But why the hell did you both have to come back to life, goddammit?!
Answer me! Which one is Yoshikage Kira?
Both!
We're going to blow you away until there's no trace of you left...
With our bombs...
His ability! It explodes whenever it touches something!
Hoo... Interested in my Stand? Here, I'll give it all to you...
Get ready to be blown to bits!
Two Deadly Queens?! As if he wasn't dangerous enough already!!
They're both Kira? What the hell?
Hold up, hold up, hold up. I don't get it either. I need to get my thoughts in order...
Yes! Josuke Higashikata, blown to pieces!
Tonight...I'm going to sleep better than I have in a long time...
Shining Diamond...
I don't think I'll ever start liking your ability.
But I'm still going to blow you away in the end... Both of you!
Hold it right there! Are you two looking for the parts of the Holy Corpse, too?
Hmph. Who cares about a corpse?
Huh? Then what are you even doing in this era?!
All the two of us want is a nice, tranquil life. Nothing more.
Yeah right. You murder people for fun!
Wait!
You...are you really both Yoshikage Kira?
That we are...
But not the Yoshikage Kira you were hoping for.
What?
Urggh...
H-Hey, Josukeee!
What happened? I can't remember anything. It's all blank...
I'm not so sure either. You all right? You look pale.
Wait... What... What did I do?
Oh?
Yeah, we finally got some resonance! Must be a part of the Holy Corpse nearby!
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
You got the Holy Corpse (Heart)!
My friends have some of the other Holy Corpse parts, too.
Come to think of it, they might have found all of them by now.
What's this? Wait... What?
Okay then, take me back to your world with you.
What?
What do you mean? Where are you two going?
Don't tell me...you're going to find Yasuho?!
I'm coming too! Take me with you!
Y-You're coming too?
Of couuuurse! I'm not gonna let you get a head start on me!
Yoshikage Kira... The Holy Corpse...
I might be able to find a clue to who I am!(22405)
