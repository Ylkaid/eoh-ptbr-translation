(22406)Mr Joestar... Josuke...
They're behind schedule. Wonder if something's keeping them...
...
Aha!
We just got back!
Mr Joestar!
And, er...
I'm Johnny. This here's Slow Dancer.
We're back!
Josuke!
Brought back a nice Holy Corpse part, plus some new allies!
Oh, warmest welcomes.
This place...reminds me of our town, somehow...
Hey! Where's Yasuhoooo?
No idea. You're the one who mentioned her.
Whaaat?
Aaaall right! Now then, let me check out the corpse!
Mr. Joestar, you've got the eyes;
Joseph has the ears;
Jotaro has the body;
Josuke's got the left arm;
Giorno has the head;
Jolyne has the right arm...
What about you, Johnny, and Hat Josuke?
I've got the legs.
Me? The heart.
Then we've gathered eight parts of the Holy Corpse so far.
But what of the last part?
Odd. Why isn't the corpse's light leading us to it?
Speedwagon? I just had a thought.
Remember when the anomaly was affecting Bucciarati and Fugo, and they ran away?
They vanished in the Holy Corpse's light, too.
Could that have something to do with the last corpse part?
Hya hya hya hya!
All the Joestars are together now, I see!
You did a fine job gathering up the corpse all by yourselves!
Unfortunately, none of you will ever see all the parts...
Because the core of the body...the most critical part!
The spine...has already been claimed by the Noble One!
What did you say!?
You are all destined to die here and lose the corpse...
But! The Noble One won't even have to lift a finger.
Ke-KYAAAH!
My Justice...shall dispatch you all in one fell swoop!
Justice wants to dance!
Two, three, aaaand here we go! Moo-kee-kee-kee-kee!
Go on, keep wasting your strength! Your attacks feel lighter than mosquito bites!
Prepare to be crushed! You measly aaaants!
Justice is with me!

Nggggh!
Damn you, Joestars...you and your miserable defiance...
But my work here is already done!
I know now, beyond all doubt,
that the Joestars...have gathered EIGHT of the Holy Corpse paaaaarts!
What a weird old woman.
Who was she calling out to?
!
Whoaaaa! E-Earthquake?
No, this isn't a quake... I know what this is...
Th-this feeling!
I-I don't know what's happening here, but I just broke out in a cold sweat!
This pressure...it feels like it's digging into my soul...
This pitch black sensation!
Whaaat...is thiiiis?!
This aura...
It can't be...
Ah!
The Holy Corpse repels all evil.
However, at the same time!
It also seeks its other parts.
The parts you wield...
They reacted to the spine I possess, and drew you into this main world...
Gimme a break...
I didn't want to believe it, but there's no doubting what I'm seeing right now...
DIO!!
Hmph.
(If I defeat him, Gyro will come back...)
Here we go!
Tusk Act 4!
So that's the energy that put Valentine in checkmate...
MUDAAA!
Wha...
Golden Wind Requiem!
MUDA!!
You'll never reach reality!
Hmm...
Huh?!
Star Platinum!!
ORAAA!
Heh heh heh.
What?!
Gah ha ha ha ha hah!
Such weakness!
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!
Urgh!
Waaaah!
Gwwaaaaaah!!
Waaah! Jotaro! Everybody! They've all been beaten!
What...What happened?
Why didn't Requiem work?!
He just took a direct hit from Tusk Act 4! Why didn't anything happen?!
I know that I felt Star Platinum smash his skull in...
This power is something completely different from vampiric regeneration or The World's ability to stop time...
I was told that the Joestars had defeated me here in this main world...
But if those Stands are all you've got, I fail to see how!
Th...This is...
The corpse parts gravitate toward one another!
The parts you've gathered pulled the spine to you along with I, DIO!
And now, it's the spine's turn to pull all your corpse parts toward me!
Fu ha ha ha ha!! This feels fantastic, Joestaaaaaars!!
Bow down before my reality!
This is bad! We can't let that mist touch us!
Nnn?
What...
I'm one part short...
Huh?!
Tch!
Of course... Jotaro Kujo...
It seems I must defeat him in this world as well...
Enyaba!
Summon my pawns!
The corpse parts gravitate toward one another...
Give them the Holy Corpse parts and have them chase after Jotaro and the others.
As you command.
The corpse part Jotaro holds must be the Joestars' last hope...
I'll rip that hope from them and plunge them into the depths of despair...
Then at last, I'll erase them from this main world!
With my Stand: The World Over Heaven...(22534)
