(22922)Hee hee! We found you!
It's gig time, baby! YEAH!
Harvest! Steal the corpse part from him!
Let me show you a REAL knockouuuut!
And then...if he fights back...
Kill him!!
It's time for MAX POWER! No holding back!
I'm gonna burn you all to a crisp!
We done did it! It's my corpse part! I got it back!
I finally expressed...my heart! And the scream of my soul!

Uuuuhh...
Wha-what was I doing?
Whoa! Josuke?! And Okuyasu!
Whoa my ass!
Damn it, Shigechi! You know how much trouble you caused us?!
Uurgh... Ummm...
Wakey-wakey, Akiraaaa!
O-Okuyasu?!
Time for you to lend a helping hand too!
Hiiieeeeeee!
Hm?!
Weather Forecast...
Weather Forecast manipulates weather.
The souls of dead criminals will return in the form of frogs, in search of fellow travelers along the road to the netherworld.
I've come...for your souls...
Avoid the frogs and attack Weather Forecast!
If you just would have let the frogs take you...
You could have spared yourself some suffering...
There's no stopping my ability now!
Not until it's reduced this whole world to rubble!
Even I can't stop my ability. It's coming from the deepest recesses of my heart.
Either I kill you!
Or you kill me...
Let this all end...
Scatter the despair in my heart throughout this world as well...
All I have left to hope for is that I might reach Heaven...
Ugh...
I-I... What...
Jolyne?
So you are the Weather I know...
You're too close...Weather.
But I guess...I can put up with it for now...
Only for now...
You've found the Holy Corpse (Head)!
...Did all that make sense?
...
If Pucchi is scheming something, then...
I suppose I'll need to survive a bit longer.
Let me come and help you, Jolyne.
Of course, Weather!
Guh...
I've been running through dozens of parallel worlds...
How many dimensions must I traverse?!
Ahh!!
Something wrong, Valentine?
DIO!!
Is something chasing you? You look so terrified... Heh heh.
(panting)
His Stand's too powerful...
I can't beat him!
Not even if I had the entire Holy Corpse!
I can't defeat this man!
By the way...you still haven't answered my question from before.
What did you tell Jotaro?
I asked you this question some time ago, Valentine.
What are you hoping to accomplish through them?
Don't tell me...you're conceited enough to believe that you could actually defeat I, DIO?!
(panting)
Hey, Valentine...
Have you ever wondered what it is humans live for?
Humans live to overcome their fears and worries, so they can live in peace.
I can give you the reality you long for.
The reality that will finally bring peace to the depths of your heart...
It'd be such a shame to kill a superior Stand user like you.
That's why I never overwrote you completely.
Now, how about abandoning your worthless ambitions and serving me for eternity?
...
There is not a speck of hesitation in my heart or my actions!
All that I do, I do for justice!
Hmph! Then you leave me no choice.
You'll just have to die now, Valentine!
D4C!
This is...
The World Over Heaven.
I, DIO, can arrive at any reality I wish!
Funny Valentine...
You no longer exist...
anywhere.
Is there a Holy Corpse part here?
?
What the hell? When did...
(I don't believe it! Jotaro!)
Just now... Time jumped!
Now we're in the boss'...
No, Diavolo's range!
He's here! I can feel him...
He's right next to us!
I meant for you to see...
When I used Emperor Crimson.
Urgh!
B-Boss!
We're getting closer! We're too close!
An anomaly must have allowed him to escape from the effects of Requiem's power...
If I'd wanted to take you by surprise, I could have mown down a number of you just now.
You are all still standing because I chose not to do so.
...
You've stolen my land, my money, and everything else I own...
But I don't care.
Giorno Giovanna, I will defeat you in order to keep moving forward!
That is the only reason I've come here!
Now watch as I defeat you, and ascend the true emperor's throne!
Futile is futile, no matter how many times you try.
I will reclaim that which you have stolenÂ - the pride of an emperor!
What pride did you ever have, Boss?
I, Diavolo, have always been an emperor who rose to power through strife!
Your "pride" only exists on the surface. Don't you realize that?
It's pointless, no matter how many times you try. And I hate doing pointless things. MUDA MUDA...
Victory! I, Diavolo, am the true emperor!
Urgggh...
Yes! The boss is no match for Giorno!
He totally beat him!
Urk...
My body is aching from the intensity of your power...
However... Heh heh heh. Now I've found it...
Your weak point!
What?
You can have this corpse part. Consider it a farewell gift.
But the next time we meet...
I'll have you singing your own requiem!
...
You got the Holy Corpse (Legs)!
Puny humans! Prepare yourselves!
Resistance is futile! We'll finish this in one fell swoop!
You all came here to die like dogs!
I'm going to cut your flesh into pieces, then line all your organs up on the ground!
I'll cut you open and scoop everything out!!
I'll butcher you right where you stand! WRYYYYYYYYYYYY!
Whaaaat? Why do you look so tense? You still want to keep fighting!?
MUDA MUDA MUDA!! I'll drink you dry!
The corpse belongs with I, Dio!
I'm going to use the power of the corpse to rise to the top!
Impossible! How could I, Dio...
be defeated...by mere humans?!
How dare you...
How could you do this to me?!
I'll remember this! You'll get what's coming to you!
Miserable humans! Next time, I'll drain your veins until not a drop of blood is left!
Tch... Again?
Ugh!
Avdol! Iggy!
(What's this?! Jotaro?)
Finally...we found you!
Avdol, Iggy...
We're gonna bring you back to normal in no time.
Hmph. It doesn't matter how many people you gather!
I'll burn you all until there's nothing left!
Grrrr!
My hellfire will immolate you!
Gwararararf!
Woof! Woof!
It doesn't matter where you hide! My fire will smoke you out!
Heh heh heh. It hurts to go up in flames, doesn't it?
Grrr! Grrr!
There won't even be a trace of you left. You will burn to ash and vanish from the world!
Awoooooooooooo!
Urrghh...
Rrf...
Hmm?
I could have sworn that I just charged into DIO's mansion...
Mr Joestar... What's going on here?
Avdol! You recognize us!
Avdol...
Avdol!
We'll explain what's happening later.
In the meantime...
Thank goodness you're back to normal!
???
Looks like you're finally back to normal too, huh, Iggy?
You little show-off! Heh heh heh.
Grrrr!!
Waaaaaah!
Gyaaaaaaah!
Gimme a break.
!
There you are, Father Pucchi.
I've got something to ask you.
Hm... DIO's power?
Even if you know the secret of my dear friend's power, there's nothing you can do.
You are fools to defy DIO...
Prepare to receive the judgment of Heaven, here and now!
Ngh!?
His power extends even to zombies...
Go forth, zombies!
Punish the fools who dare oppose my dear friend!
Anyone can reach Heaven if they follow him.
Even if they're undead.
For those who would sneer at Heaven...this is a suitable fate.
!
Gimme a break. Looks like these guys weren't pious enough.
...
So. You up next?
Do you not feel this strange destiny at work?
Right now, we're in a fateful place.
All of this began right here, at the Joestar house.
Right here, my dear friend first encountered his destiny, and took his first steps on a path that would lead him to unimaginable heights.
A path toward the salvation of the human race...
Just as ships once used starlight to guide their voyages in the sea,
those who meet him and follow his path...
will journey toward his Heaven!
People meet through gravity. We meet those whom we are destined to meet!
That itself is reality!
Those who attain reality will be blessed!
In Him, mankind will find salvation!
This is what I've longed for!
The Eyes of Heaven!
...Pfft.
...
This, too, must be some strange kind of destiny...
So fitting that I would finish you off in this fateful place.
I guess you don't feel like telling me about DIO's power, huh?
Well, if that's the case, then sorry...
But now I'm going to ask you with my fists!
Lay down your burdens. Entrust everything to DIO...
In the name of my dear friend, DIO! In the name of attaining Heaven!
I will lay you all to rest!
I'll strike you down with every ounce of strength in my body!
I will put an end to this, here and now!
Even now?! Can you still not fathom the sublime wonder of the Eyes of Heaven?
Ooogh...
All right, spit it out. Tell me about DIO's ability!
Fool...
To think that the dwellers of such a fragile straw house could even set foot in our fortress and threaten our profound goals..
And yet, I feel...strangely relieved.
For now...I am convinced of my dear friend's victory.
You see, it is all as he foretold.
Here you are, 36 souls,
all ready to be sacrificed to DIO!
What?
Heh heh heh...
I can't let you catch me.
Joseph's Stand, Hermit Purple, is telepathic, after all...
Just as our planet has a fixed 7-to-3 ratio of ocean to land,
there is also a fixed number of living souls...
Only a certain number of souls can coexist.
...
DIO...
I love you as I love God Himself!
!
36 souls?
...
You got the Holy Corpse (Eyes)!
But if you consider the idea that one man can possess more than one soul...
What do you think he would see?
What do you think his future would bring?
I wanted to go with him...
To see what he would create...with the world...
Did you say "sacrificed"?(23179)
