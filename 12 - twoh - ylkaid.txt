(23180)Hm?
That's...
DIO!
If you're here,
then you must have defeated Pucchi...
My congratulations, Joestars.
You've done well to reclaim your allies and the corpse.
And now once again, you stand before I, DIO!
DIO...
Bastard...
Tch! Just listen to all that damn bravado!
You're all alone now!
...
Hmph.
I already took care of Valentine...
What?
I don't know what he was trying to tempt you into doing, but it matters little now.
Now then, Joestars.
In the world I come from, you've already been exterminated.
Your deaths will serve as a tribute to my dear friend Pucchi.
...
Come. I'll play with you for a while.
Fight me, Jotaro.
...
I still have no grasp on DIO's ability...
But that asshole's not taking this seriously. This might be our chance...
His Stand is a lot like the DIO we fought before...
Power, plus precise movements... It's the same type as Star Platinum!
Gimme a break. So good so far, but here's where the real problem starts...
Kneel before my reality!

How do you like that?! Jotaro's Star Platinum is invincible!
Hey, we might be able to do this! Give 'im the finishing blow!
Geh!
Urgh...
I knew it... Again!
The damage is disappearing from DIO's body...
It's just like when Johnny and Giorno fought him before!
This is it! His ability!
What, no more attacks? Are you done already?
Shall I go ahead and finish you off?
Ggh...
...
Overwriting reality?
!
You've figured out my Stand's power?
Thanks for the hint...
So what? It makes no difference...
Soon you'll come to know it better than you ever hoped for!
Ahh!!
Impossible! What is this?!
Hadn't you noticed?
The World Over Heaven already hit that turtle.
And now!
To overwrite reality!
!
Ahh! The turtle!
It disappeared!
I've just given you and your allies a terrific dose of my power and blasted them into various eras!
No normal human could possibly withstand this power!
Before long, their bodies will begin to wither away to nothing!
Just like a vampire who's been attacked with Hamon!
!
The only thing that can save them is the light of the Holy Corpse!
What the hell are you planning?
Hah hah hah... Is now really the time to be asking that?
Jotaro. I'm leaving this fight to you.
!
Thinking back on all we've seen, I believe you're the only one who has a chance of defeating him.
We'll do something about the others.
You're in charge of beating the living daylights out of him, Jotaro!
This will be the last battle, without a doubt...
...
Been a long time coming.
Yup. The curtain's coming down.
I'm staying behind.
We can fight him together. Right, Dad?
...
Hoo...
Even after following a holy corpse to get here,
I didn't think this would turn into such a bizarre adventure.
Hmph.
We've been waiting for you, scoundrels!
Feast your eyes on my ultimate Hamon attack!
Mr Zeppeli!
Caesar!
I'm sorry, you two...
I'll finish this quickly!
I'll stake the pride of the Zeppeli family on this!
We're going to defeat you!
I'll pour Hamon straight into you!
Yes, that's it! The sound of a successful Hamon!
Control your breathing, then create energy! Ruoooooh!
Amazing! That's the power of truly refined Hamon!
I just hit you with my ultimate Hamon!
Yes! Attaboy, Caesar!
Urgh... Where are we?
N-No, it can't be... We fell under DIO's control?
That's right, you idiot! Don't scare me like that!
What we ought to be scared of is DIO's power!
I can't believe he could instantly put the Zeppelis back under his control like that!
Still, it looks like we really can restore them with the corpse's light like before.
You two, stay here for a while and rest.
We've got to move forward!
Nyo ho ho! There you are, you filthy terrorists!
I'm going to beat you into next week! You can bet on that!
Gyro! You?!
Joshu...
I'll bring you back to normal no matter how many times it takes, Gyro!
I don't like you! I'm gonna crush you!
Yeah! Into tiny pieces!
You're finiiiished! Shiiiiit! Shiiiiit!
I just can't hold myself back, because I know I'm gonna kill you!
We're gonna flatten you like pancakes!
Just wait. I'm going to send you flying even farther next time!
Have you learned your lesson yet, shitbrain?
Nyo, ho ho ho! Flawless victory!
Is...is this...
Ow... OUCH! Wh-what happened?
Good! You're back to normal.
Gyro, just wait here for me.
It'll be over soon!
Early bird gets the worm, Six Bullets!
We won't let you get away with this!
Mista! And you're...
Koichi!
Great!
Now that I think about it, we've never fought before!
Don't underestimate my Reverb!
Aim right between the eyes!
Once my gun takes aim,
there's no escape. 100 shots, 100 hits!
Let 'em have it, Reverb!
Paralyze them!
No misses!
Now I'll splatter you! Reverb Act 3: FREEZE!!
Urgh... What happened?
Wait. I... What was I doing?
Yooo! Glad to see you're back to normal, Koichi.
All right! This'll do!
I got a little nervous when DIO started acting all high and mighty, but we're in good shape!
Now we just need to finish bringing everyone back to normal!
...
What's the matter, Giorno?
Well, something's bothering me.
I just can't figure out...
why DIO would make us do all this.
At first I thought it might be to split us up, but...
Now I wonder if his goal wasn't simply to make us fight.
What?!
Ah!
Whoa!
Huh?!
Dammit!
My...My strength...
Gwaah!
Waaah!
Waaah!
Gaahh!
Waaah!
Aaahhh!
Waaah!
Gwaagh!
Waaah!
Kyaaahhh!
Urggh!
Gwaagh!
Urggh!
Gwooh!
Grargrarh!
Gwaagh!
Waaah!
Waaah!
Urggh!
Kyaaahhh!
Waaah!
Gwooh!
Gwooh!
Urggh!
Gwaagh!
Waaah!
Kyaahh!
Gwaagh!
Gwooh!
Urggh!
Gwaagh!
Gwaagh!
Heh heh heh...
I see the pride and courage of the Joestar family has allowed them to triumph over destiny!
However!
The moment you did so, your souls' power reached its maximum!
!?
The time is ripe!
The souls of the Joestar family...
And the Holy Corpse...
Will now be mine!
!
Wh-what is that?!
Nnnnngh!
Ggh!
Ku ha ha ha ha ha!
It...It can't be...
Damn you! Their souls...and the Holy Corpse!
Hmph!
Now all that's left is the two of you!
Jotaro! You're up first!
Tch!
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDAAAAA!
D-Dad!
I figured I'd have to use The World Over Heaven's true ability to finish you off!
Nnnnngh!
I'm going to erase you from existence, Jotaro!
Gwaaaah!!
My hand will always reach reality...
A reality free of obstructions...
...
ORAAA!
Whaaaaat!?
Ugh!
Wh...
What...What is this?
This is...Over Heaven!
Jotaro! You re-overwrote the reality that I, DIO, chose?!
I-Impossible!
The same type of Stand!
The World and Star Platinum are the same type of Stand!
...
Dad...you countered his ability?
Bring it, DIO!
This is it! The final round!!
Show me your reality, Jotaro!
Show me the true power of Star Platinum!
This feeling... So this is Over Heaven...
The power to overwrite reality...
So this is your reality or whatever, DIO?
He's so strong! I've never seen my dad like this before!
No one can destroy the reality that I, DIO have created...
No!
It can't be!!
How is this possible?!
How could this Joestar descendant...
assimilate into my reality?!
Pfft... Reality?
I couldn't really see it... What happened to your body, Dad?
Fine! We'll decide whose reality is superior right here!
Let's finish this, Jotaro!
(In order to overwrite reality with The World Over Heaven...)
(I need an enormous amount of soul energy, and time to charge it.)
(Strengths and weaknesses are two sides of the same coin... There will always be some kind of trade off...)
No one can destroy my reality!
Know your plaaaace!
Heh heh heh...
Fu ha ha ha ha...
FU HA HA HA HAAAAAH!
!
Ugh!
Jotaro!
Allow me to complement you on your Stand, and your mental prowess!
Unfortunately...
Since you've just barely awakened to your ability...
You can't use Over Heaven properly!
MUDAAA!!
Ugggh!
Stone Ocean!
Hmph!
Waaah!
Jolyne!
Heh heh heh... One left!
Unbelievable... Never for a moment did I think you'd be able to intervene in my reality...
But by its very nature, there can only ever be one reality...
And the reality that I, DIO, create...is more than enough!
Ggh!
You have my gratitude.
Thanks to you, I gathered the Holy Corpse in no time at all,
and made it over to this main world without lifting a finger.
And now that I've obtained your souls, my Stand shall rise to even greater heights.
The Joestar bloodline...
It was always such a nuisance, like piles of dog shit strewn over the path of my destiny...
But at last, at the very end,
it turns out the Joestars were always destined to serve me!
Fu ha ha ha ha ha!
Shut...up!
Now then, Jotaro,
Last of the Joestar family...
I'm going to finish you off personally.
Heh heh heh heh.
All I have to do is blow your head off,
and the bloodline of my vile nemeses will disappear forever...
Joestars...
The last...
Bloodline...
Disappear...
Now diiiie! Jotaro!!
Disappear.
???
This armlet's from the main world...
Gwaaaah!!
Wh...Whaaaaat?!
What...is this?!
Gwaahh!!
You...You maggot! What are you...
So it's true...
Looks like your ability activates whenever your fist hits something.
!
You won't be overwriting any realities until that arm heals.
Ggghh...
(panting)
...
How many seconds will it take to heal?
Once it does, I'm smashing Star Platinum right into you!
C'mon!
MUDAAA!
How's that?! I've blinded you!
I've won! Now DI...
ORAAA!
GWAAAAHH!
You're a joke, DIO.
And your reality...
It's all just a fantasy.
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
ORAAAAAAAA!
GBWAAAAAAAHHHH!
Don't make me repeat myself...
You pissed me off.
!
Ngh!
...
Gimme a break.
ORAAAA!!
...
?
Oh Jotaro, there you are!
We got word from the hospital. They said you'd regained consciousness.
...
C'mon, let's get going!
?
What, something the matter?
Oh, nothing.
Those wounds were pretty serious. Looks like it's a month of complete rest.
All that's important is that we're all alive...
...
Sorry, Jean Pierre.
We've got to go back to Holly...
Yeah. Hurry home and put her at ease.
Just leave them to me.
I'll take good care of them.
I'll make sure to come back when it's discharge time.
I'll hold you to that.
Eleven years later...Â -1999-
Whoa!
Huh?!
Ahh! Ahh!
Strange... I felt like I hit something and fell down...
Sorry, I was looking the other way...
Looks like I lost track of her.
(H-He's huuuuge! He's gotta be over six feet tall!)
(Oh...)
(Wait...have I seen him somewhere before?)
...
...
Stay close to me.
You know, I wanted to leave you at home with your mom to watch over the place.
I only brought you along so you'd stop bawling and throwing tantrums.
Just keep quiet until my business is done. Got it?
Yeah!
I'm gonna go look at the turtle!
...
Gimme a break.
I've got a question for you...
Do you know the Higashikata family?
I came to this town...
...to pay them a visit.(23553)
