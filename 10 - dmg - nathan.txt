(22535)It's...It's Air Supplena Island!
Did Jotaro's Holy Corpse part pull us here to safety?
That was close... If that mist had gotten to us, we would have been in serious trouble!
Damn, so that asshole was the guy behind the anomalies?
That was...DIO!
We lost nearly all the corpse parts.
Damn it!
Our attacks didn't even faze him! Why!?
Requiem has the power to prevent any reality from happening.
When my Stand's fist hit his Stand, I'm sure that Requiem activated. And yet...
My attack was negated, as if I never had such an ability in the first place!
...
Valentine!
I've no need for you now.
The one I'm here for is...
You, Jotaro Kujo.
You're going to fight me, here and now.
Show me what your ability can do!
...
Hmm...
I don't know what you're planning, but you asked for it.
Whoever you are, you've got one hell of an attitude.
Star Platinum... Precise movements, superb energy, and even the ability to stop time...
A speed so terrific it surpasses light and stops time itself...
Not only is it the most powerful Stand the world's ever seen, it's practically invincible...
But what I want to see is beyond even that.
Show me what your Stand has been hiding!
At this rate, you'll accomplish nothing. Have we...no hope at all?

I...knew it...
Your Star Platinum is the same type as DIO's Stand!
That's why your corpse part wasn't stolen!!
?
There's no time, so I'll be brief.
At first, my only goal was to gather all the parts of the Holy Corpse.
That, and nothing more.
However, when that Johnny Joestar over there fired his Infinite Spin at me...
I began to fly through parallel worlds, looking for a way to escape from it.
I can visit parallel worlds that are similar to this main one,
thanks to the power of my Stand.
Even I can't be sure how many parallel worlds there are, but they all exist aside one another.
Then, I met him.
A DIO from a parallel world?
Indeed. The main world version of you defeated DIO in the 1988 battle,
but there are parallel worlds where that never occurred.
In that particular world, he turned the tables on the Joestars and conquered the world as he'd planned,
using his Stand power, which had evolved to its final stage.
...
He caught me. There was no escape.
His Stand's power is incredibly powerful, terrifying...and infinite.
Johnny's Infinite Spin wouldn't leave my body no matter what I did,
yet he made it disappear with a wave of his hand.
Urk...
When DIO discovered that the world he'd conquered was only one of many parallel worlds,
he set his sights on the main world and began his invasion.
...
So what do you want me to do about it?
I want you to defeat him.
I'm pretending to be under his control and aiding his invasion as I search for someone with the power to take him down.
That someone is you, Jotaro.
DIO's Stand...
The World Over HeavenÂ - What kind of ability does it have? How many secrets does it hide?
I don't know. I couldn't find any clues, unfortunately...
However, yours is the only part of the Holy Corpse that he couldn't steal. There's no way that was by chance.
We can't trust this guy!
He's obviously got some ulterior motive!
Everything I've been telling you is true.
I am not acting for my own personal gain.
I don't want the Holy Corpse for power, or to control anyone.
Everything I do is for the prosperity of my country and its people!
However, DIO's aims transcend nations. He's gunning to conquer the world itself...
He must be stopped at all costs!
Someone needs to learn the secrets of his ability and defeat him.
You, Jotaro Kujo...are the only one who can do that.
I suspect DIO will distribute the corpse parts to his underlings and have them search for yours.
Defeating his minions and reclaiming the Holy Corpse parts should bring us closer to defeating DIO himself.
...
There's one more thing I must tell you.
I heard the DIO from this main world has already been defeated.
Are his remains still here?
Huh? What are you talking about?
If two of the same thing from different worlds come in contact with each other, they will cancel each other out and disappear.
DIO doesn't know this.
Hey, hang on. That doesn't make sense.
I'm standing right here with an old grandpa version of myself from 50 years in the future, but we haven't disappeared.
You two may be from different eras, but you're both the same world's Joseph Joestar.
Therefore, you will not disappear.
DIO, however, is different. He comes from an parallel world. If we could bring him in contact with the corpse of this world's DIO...
If luck is on our side, we could erase him before he even has a chance to use his powers.
Once the sun touched DIO's body, it turned to dust.
There's nothing left of him.
I see... Unfortunate, but so be it.
Then I have nothing more to say.
Whether or not you believe me is up to you.
I only ask that you choose what is right!
I may be late with this, but that was a weird conversation.
Valentine is not to be trusted...
Trust him or not, we've got to get the corpse parts back.
Jonathan's right!
We have to start all over? This is gonna take forever...
No. We'll get it done much quicker this time,
since our enemies will be lying in wait for us wherever we go.
We're going to take Valentine's advice, then?
Looks like it. Right, Dad?
So the plan's to recover the Holy Corpse parts that DIO stole,
free our allies from his control,
then find out his Stand's secret and defeat him?
Gimme a break.
I might actually break a sweat this time...
DIO's ability is the real problem here.
We have no idea how it works! If we can't figure that out, we'll just get swatted down again.
Johnny...
When you fought DIO, it looked like his fists repelled your attacks. Does that sound right to you?
Yeah...well, no, not quite.
I wouldn't say he repelled my attacks, so much as negated them.
Even my surefire, one-hit-kill nail bullets disappeared!
...
Something wrong?
I have a feeling DIO's power and my Golden Wind Requiem may have something in common...
My Requiem has the power to negate an opponent's will and actions, and prevent them from reaching reality.
However, his power is the reverse of that.
Perhaps it allows him to turn whatever he wishes into reality.
Whaaat?
In our battle, he overwrote reality and made our attacks ineffective.
Bloody hell! That's absurd!
If that's really the case, how could anyone beat him?
We can't allow him to stay in this world! We've got to find his weak point, no matter what...
I'm going to fight!
When my fist met his Stand, I felt pure evil.
He must be stopped!
All I want is to collect the corpse parts so that I can bring Gyro back.
If he's going to try to get in my way, then I'll make sure that the next time we meet...he dies instantly!
Tch! We've already got our hands full with the Pillar Men...
What a pain in the ass. It's gonna be such a relief to crush this guy!
All that talk about worlds makes this whole thing feel so big it's almost unreal.
But at this rate, Morioh Town will be in danger too. Count me in!
I just want to know who I really am...
But it looks like we're not going anywhere until we defeat him.
DIO was the one who influenced Father Pucchi... That alone tells me how dangerous he is.
We've got to seal that power of his away.
Stop it! Don't listen to a word he says!
...
I completely understand why you'd be so cautious.
I can also understand why you're concealing that gun you plan to shoot me with...
You're damn right I am... This is the gun you used to shoot Gyro,
and now it's going to do the same to you!
Ahh!
No way!
Whoaaaaa!
!
Is someone with a corpse part here?
I see...
Him, huh?
This guy is really annoying, but I guess we've got no choice...
Oh, my. It seems that since we last met...
The Noble One... Lord DIO gave you a nasty thrashing.
...
I'm not here to make small talk. Listen up.
Let's have ourselves a gamble. The stakes are...our Holy Corpse parts.
Oh, really now?
Well, you've certainly got my attention. But what makes you think I'll play along?
I'll throw in my soul.
What?
Course, you'll need to put something up in return.
If you lose...you'll tell me the secret of DIO's Stand.
!
Pfft. No falling off your chair this time?
Please, Jotaro, do you think I'm that easy to provoke?
I happen to know of a person far more knowledgeable about Lord DIO's power than I.
If I lose, I'll tell you their name. How's that?
That'll do.
Now, let me hear you name your stakes, one more time.
I bet my soul, and my part of the Holy Corpse.
Good!
OK! OPEN THE GAME!
Let's begin!
You lose, Darby.
...
Let me ask you one thing, Jotaro.
Why didn't you stop time?
I was in fine form today.
I know I would have sensed if any Stand powers were interfering.
Were you holding me in contempt?
...
I didn't think I could beat you by simply stopping time.
I had a feeling you'd have a trap lying in wait if I did.
So I didn't do it. Simple as that.
You really are a detestable man...
Take it and go!
You got the Holy Corpse (Left Arm)!
Father Pucchi...
!
He's the one who knows about Lord DIO's ability.
One might even call him an aide. He supports all of Lord DIO's efforts.
He's also deeply connected to your future...
If it were me, I'd want to ask Father Pucchi some questions before I challenged Lord DIO again.
Though Pucchi possesses a rather troublesome Stand power himself.
You really are spilling the beans now, huh?
Well, I am a gambler. I don't much care for that priest and his miracle-peddling.
Plus, I wouldn't want Lord DIO to erase your soul.
I've prepared a special place for it in my collection, after all.
...
I'm going to be here for a while. If you find yourself in a gambling mood, stop by again.
Oh, wait. One more thing.
Lord DIO's power and my Osiris have one thing in common.
They both have a connection to the soul.
!
While I just collect souls for the sheer pleasure of it...
Lord DIO needs them to fully manifest his power.
(...Souls?)
(Just like in his notebook that I burned up in Cairo.)
(Does this have something to do with what was written in it?)
What's that supposed to mean?
Good question. All I know for sure is how my Osiris works.
You've got all the information I have to give now.
Like I said, if you want to know more about Lord DIO's ability, then you should seek out Father Pucchi.
At laaaaaast! I've found you, Jotaro Kujo!
Now, to enlist your corpse part in the name of my armyyyyy!
If you don't wanna get hurt,
then hand the damn corpse parts over now!
One wrong move and I'll shoot! No wrong moves and I'll shoot anywaaaaay!
For now, we'll leave you only half dead!
Stop, villains! I, Stroheim and the military are here to stop you once and for all!!
Watch closely! Peel your eeeyes! And sear our proud and gallant figures into your retinaaaaaas!
Come a little closer! Don't you run from me!
I'm gonna wipe you you clean outta this world!
And thus, Jotaro Kujo's corpse part has been claimed by my army!
You...You son of a bitch! Are you planning on hogging all the glory?
Urrgh... Where...
Okuyasuuu! You're fiiinally back to normal!
Unngh... What...
Rise and shine, Stroheim!
J-JoJo?
Gimme a break...
Ngh!
Found ya, terrorist scum!
Hmm... Looks like we'll need to take on these evildoers now.
Prepare yourself, scoundrels!
Now! I'm going to crush you! Beyond all recognition!
What's the matter, out of breath already?
You really think that's enough to defeat me?!
Time for me to put an end to all this!
With...this Infinite Spin energy!
Feast on my Hamooon!
This is what it means to be beaten beyond all recognition. Nyo ho ho!
Ungh... J-JoJo?
Mr Zeppeli!
Uuurgh... Is this Rocky Mountain Village?
Hey, Johnny? The hell's going on?
What're we doing all the way back here?
G-Gyro! You remember me?
You got the Holy Corpse (Heart)!
...And that bring us here.
Hmmm. What a strange twist of fate...
In that case, JoJo, we'll be coming with you!
Thank you very much. Now we're bound to win!
This place...
This is the overpass where I defeated DIO...
?
What...
DIO's armlet...
What did Valentine say again?
If two of the same thing from different worlds meet, they'll negate each other...
Maybe I can use this...
You got DIO's Armlet!
I've found you at last...Jotaro Kujo!
I think I'll help myself to that corpse part of yours.
I hope you're prepared...to be split into pieces by my zippers!
My zippers can split anything apart.
Be it your arm, or even your neck...
Hand over the corpse part, now!
I could even play soccer with your head if I wanted to!
Mission accomplished...
Oof...
Wha-what happened? Am I...?
Bucciarati!
We did it!
Glad to see you're finally back to normal!
Bucciarati...
You got the Holy Corpse (Ears)!
...And that should bring you up to speed.
...
Well, if I'm still here...
That must mean there's still something left for me to do.
Giorno. Will you let me help out?
Bucciarati...
Is this...a prison?
Hm?
That woman...wasn't she Koichi's...
I've found you,
dear...
Why are you dragging my cute little Koichi around?
I'm going to hang you up now, so get ready!
(Jotaro! That voice...)
Whoa! What is this, a prison?!
It appears to be an American prison.
This is a golden opportunity. I ought to take some reference photos.
Yukako!
Little Koichi, how I've missed you...
I'll hang you the highest of all!
Hey, Koichi...
It's all right. I'll do the fighting.
I've got to save Yukako!
Do you love me, Koichi?
Yukako...
If you really love me, then die for me!
Her mind is too strong! She's a monster!
Your sounds won't work on me!
The power of her mind is overwhelming! I can't believe her hair stretches this far, either!
I'm begging you, Yukako...turn back to normal!
Do you see now? Love is invincible.
K-Koichi?
Yukako! You're back to normal!
What a relief. You had me so worried!
Hm?
W-Worried? You, Koichi?
You were worried...about me?
Hm?!
Who's there? Show yourself!
Hoo. Oh dear.
I can't believe this. You again?
Why won't you just leave us alone already?
You! Yoshikage Kira!
That DIO guy forced us into giving him our corpse arm.
Not that I understand why you'd be crazy enough to fight for something so ugly and shriveled in the first place.
We planned to hide until you left. And yet, here we are...
We don't like fighting... But now that we've run into you, I suppose we have no choice.
Time for us to get a little payback!
I heard about this, but damn... There really are two of that douchebag now?!
Payback? You must be dreaming.
You're the ones who are gonna get beaten to a pulp!
Bring it on! I'll swipe away your bombs and whatever else you throw at us!
We're going to settle this here and now, you two.
You pursued us here, and for that, you will get no mercy!
We'll exterminate you right here!
I can't believe it...my air bullets don't work on them?!
We've got you all figured out! Fire as many as you want, I'll shave them all away!
We'll blow you away before you can heal yourself!
Go ahead, blow me away! I'll still heal myself!
Yeah! Did you forget?!
Yeah! We're your worst nightmare!
How refreshing...
It certainly feels refreshing, doesn't it?
Urggh...
Ggh...
...
Just to make things clear,
we weren't trying to escape from you.
We could have killed you at any time, had we really wanted to...
The only reason we didn't is simply because we dislike fighting...
But those who threaten our tranquility must be stopped!
Next time... We'll be the ones to attack and erase you for good!
All of you! That's right, even the ones in the turtle! We're not going to leave a single one of you intact!
Talk all you want, you murderous scum!
You got the Holy Corpse (Right Arm)!
...And there you have it.
It's all okay by me, Koichi.
I'm going with you. I'm happy just being by your side.
I won't let DIO or anyone else tear us apart!
Yukako!
Gimme a break...
DIO...
It seems that Jotaro and his allies have already stolen half
of the <color red>Holy Corpse</color> parts that you gave to your pawns.
Not to mention, some of them have also betrayed us.
I see...
So be it.
The corpse parts affect their keepers and amplify their minds...
Along with the power of their souls.
In the end, the Holy Corpse is nothing more than a tool.
What matters is retrieving the souls of the 36 Ultimate Sinners.
The sinners who dare to oppose Heaven will be roused up by the Joestars,
and eventually make their way to DIO!
Then, when I've absorbed those 36 Sinners' souls...
I know without a doubt that I will be able to completely conquer this main world!
...
I have one more matter to report.
It seems that "he" is among the Sinners.
Hmph.
What should we do? Shall I finish him off?
No. I'll go.
DIO...
Should their souls prove unworthy as offerings to you,
would it be all right for me to handle the cleanup myself?
Of course, Pucchi.
Please, deliver our souls from
those who dare to stand in the way of Heaven.(22921)
