(21728)AmericaÂ -2011-
Jotaro's daughter, Jolyne Cujoh, has been incarcerated at G.D. St. Prison for a crime that she didn't commit,
thanks to a trap set by Father Pucchi, who is seeking The Way to Heaven.
In order to thwart Pucchi's plans, Jolyne escaped from prison together with her companions.
However, they found Pucchi lying in wait for them at Cape Canaveral,
together with Full Moon, a Stand that can change the direction of gravity...
Those buildings...
Are they upside down? No... Something's not right here...
The ground is slanted!
That...looks like some sort of facility...
Hmm...?
Cape Canaveral's terrain influenced Pucchi and gave him a new Stand!
I knew it could change the direction of gravity,
but I can't believe it can control people as well...
Jolyne, you have to run! We need to get away and regroup!
Now that those two are after us... We won't be able to win like this!
No! I can't run away.
If I run now, Pucchi will get just what he wants!
Hey...
!
!
What's going on here? Why is the gravity so weird?
Are you...Jotaro?!
Oh good! You're safe!
...
S-Something's not...right. You're young...and your clothes...
You two know me?
Oh, gimme a break. This happened once already...
(I don't know how many years in the future this is, but I must still be alive...)
Jolyne! They're here!
Ermes! Anastasia!
...
...
Hm. Looks like they've gotten tangled up in an anomaly.
Hey, woman. These two might have been your friends once, but they're your enemies now.
Pull out your Stand out and get ready!
First, we need to defeat them.
You know something about this?
Jolyne! I'll smash you to pieceeeeees!
I'll dismantle you...
I'll love every little piece of you, Jolyne.
Guess I'll have to go all-out! With Diver Drive as an opponent, I can't afford to take risks!
Ermes! Snap out of it!
Shut the hell uuuuup! You festering pukebaaall!
Gimme a break...... They're both close-range power types?
They're quite the aggressive duo...
My stickers dealt them a world of pain!
Diver Drive... "Dismantling complete"...

Ooogh...
Ggh...
Now then...
(He seems strangely confident!)
(He looks completely different and much younger, but...this is my father!)
(This is Jotaro Kujo!)
Nnnngh... Wh-What did I just do?
Urgh... I... What happened to me?
Y-You're back? Both of you?
Do you recognize me? What about Jolyne?
Why are you asking me that, Emporio?
What the hell is he talking about?
Hm?
Who are you? Why are you standing so close to Jolyne?
This is my father!
...
...
...
What did you just say?
Jolyne! Are you serious?
Have you lost your mind? Are you being affected by some Stand?
That was you, until a few minutes ago!
...No. I know that it seems crazy, but I sense the Joestar blood in him.
This man is Jotaro Kujo, my father!
I've met Jotaro.
And you're right, they definitely look alike.
...
I am Jotaro Kujo... But..."daughter?"
Gimme a break... I guess I'll save my surprise for later, though.
Hey, Gramps.
What is it?
Huh?
I've got another favor to ask.
Don't tell me... You want me to explain again?
Hey! Someone just came out of that turtle!
I'm sick and tired of hearing that line.
Just follow the old man.
What does he think I am, his personal servant? Sheesh... Hey you, come a bit closer, will you?
You too. Get in after them.
!
Oh my god! It can't be true! No way!
?
Weather Forecast!
I thought you died in the battle against Pucchi!
I'm sorry, Jolyne... But you need to die.
Weather...?
You should have never gotten involved in my cursed life...
Oh no... That's the Devil's Rainbow! It's Heavy Weather!
Listen up. It's the same as what happened with those two... He's trying to take you out.
I know. I don't want to believe it, but it certainly seems that way...
We'll just do what we did before.
Okay. In order to bring Weather back to normal... I'll beat him to a pulp!
I want to wreak total chaos...
I curse everything... Myself, and everyone who gets involved with me!
Is that how you really feel?!
As the world falls deeper into chaos, I can feel a sense of satisfaction deep at the bottom of my heart. I can't even stop it myself...
That's not true! You're just under someone else's control, that's all!
Gimme a break... That's one hell of a Stand...
Weather! I'll wake you up!
The Noble One will guide us to heaven... Even the cursed ones like me...
Jolyne... I'll be back...
Back to destroy this whole world...
Weather! Wait!
H-He disappeared! Into that light!
So he got away, huh?
Um, I don't know what to call you...
So I guess I'll just call you dad for now.
What's happening here?
I thought at first this was all Pucchi's doing, but it's not that simple, is it?
To think that we would both travel across time and traverse worlds to encounter each other in a place like this...
Jotaro Kujo...
Pucchi!
I suppose this is the first time we've met...
Although strictly speaking, this is the second time I've met the 'you' from 1988.
Whaaat...
Caaaaaw!
That's...
Squawk! (GRIN)
A...bird? Is that a falcon?
Get them, Animal Shop...
They dare to defy our Heaven, so it's time to show them Hell!
Attack Animal Shop and damage him!
SQUAAAAWK!
Pucchi...was it? What the hell did you just say?
How have we already met before?
You don't need to know. Even if I explained, you still wouldn't understand.
Pucchi! There's no way in hell I'll let you go to heaven!
I can't let you get what you're after here in Cape Canaveral!
Heh heh heh...
Jolyne. That heaven you speak of...
Are you referring to what the me from this world is seeking?
Hmph... I don't need that any more. It's useless now.
What?
The heaven that I was seeking lay elsewhere, you see.
And now, I have found it. No...he...my dear friend found it for me.
I am no longer a martyr who must continue walking down a thorny path.
I am a resident of Heaven, who has discovered the path of truth.
And now, for the sake of my dear friend and Heaven, I shall defeat you both, in body and soul!
Squawk! Squawk!
Enough with the dramatic bullshit.
What he's saying sounds completely different than before...
Let us sing praises for the new Heaven!
Squawk! Squawk!
Whatever adversity we might face, we must never lose our hope.
Hope is a powerful form of courage! It gives us the power to stand up to destiny!
Destiny is what we must conquer in order to achieve human happiness...
And for me and my dear friend, that destiny was the Joestar bloodline!
Pucchi seems like a completely different person...
I'm not hearing your lecture too well... Can you speak up a bit?
Farewell, Kujos...
Squaaaaaaawk!
I have to spread the good news across the world!
The nobility of his reality! The sheer brilliance!
What did you just say?
What did I say? You don't need to know.
You're both...quite strong...
Heh heh heh...
Have you ever seen a night sky full of glittering stars?
All the stars pull toward one another and shine even brighter...
Do you believe in 'gravity?' Do you know that there is gravitational force at work even between human beings?
Pucchi! What are you talking about?!
You probably won't be able to understand...
But we have arrived at the only path that leads to true Heaven.
A path that can guide all the humans in this world to true happiness...
The Eyes of Heaven!
What?!
Let the light from the Holy Corpse guide you, Jotaro Kujo...
When you have collected all the parts, then, and only then, will the gateway open to my dear friend's Heaven!
Squaaaaaaawk!
(That guy just now...)
(It seemed like he wasn't being affected by an anomaly... And more like he's on the side of whoever's causing them...)
Hm?!
It's resonating... There must be a piece of the Holy Corpse close by.
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
I eagerly await the day, Jotaro...
The day when you kneel before his reality!
(Gimme a break... Reality, overwriting... What the hell do any of those words mean?)
...
(Reality...overwriting...)
(Your friends become your enemies, and enemies you thought you'd defeated come back to life...)
(Reality...is being overwritten?)
L-Look!
You got the Holy Corpse (Right Arm)!
We got the corpse part...
Just three more now.
Eww! Dad, what is this?
Gramps will explain everything when you're in the turtle.
One more thing... Cut it out with the dad stuff. You're older than me, dammit...
What should I call you instead, then? "Old man," like I used to before?
I have a lot of questions to ask you later.
Gimme a break.
Nnnnn?!
What...is this?!
(H-Hey, woah! What's going on, Jotaro?)
When I tried to go in the Light Rift... It bounced me back.
What's going on here?
Hmmm...
I can't be sure, but...
I'd guess that there are only certain people who can go through to the next era.
Say what?
The Light Rifts serve as a kind of barrier, and repel people who don't have the right qualifications to go through.
What do you mean by qualifications? How are you supposed to know if you have them or not?
What's that noise? The corpse parts are resonating!
Whose is it? Whose is making a sound?
Huh? It's...mine?!
A-And mine too!
Looks like Mr Joestar and Josuke are allowed to enter the next era.
We have to split up, you mean? Sounds dangerous...
It'll be fine. Following the corpses has gotten us this far, after all...
You just take care, Mr Joestar.
Yes. Thank you, Speedwagon.
Good luck, Josuke.
Just leave this to me! I'll be back before you know it.
So...
What are we supposed to do until they get back?
Hmm. I guess we just have to stay on standby in Morioh Town...
Standby?
...
Huh? Where are you going?
I'm just going to take a look over there.
Dollars are no good in this shop, dear.
Would you like me to convert them into yen?
Really? That'd be great. Umm...what's the service charge?
Oh, you needn't worry about that.
But in return, maybe you'd consider doing me a little favor...
How would you feel about making a little bet with me?
If you win, I'll double your money.
Gambling? I'm pretty good at that, you know...
Or are you trying to con a poor tourist out of her money with some third-rate swindling?
We can make any sort of bet you like. It won't take any time. For example...
I'll flip this coin, and you can guess which side it will land on.
How about that? It's simple, but it's still a bit thrilling, don't you think?
Fine... Okay, heads!
Very well. I will bet on tails, in that case.
Wait...what happens if I lose?
I don't need any money. Instead, I'll take your soul. How about that? Your soul... Heh heh heh.
My s-soul?
(Hang on a minute... Is this guy...serious? Or is he just trying to act cool?)
Well, what do you say?
Sure, whatever...
GOOD! This is getting fun.
By the way... That's a very unusual mark that on your neck.
Hm?
Speaking of stars...
Do you know that bizarre expression that refers to the stars?
Long long ago, when people believed that Heaven was way up in the sky,
everyone thought the stars were holes used to peer down on Earth, and that they shone because of the light that came pouring out of them.
And...oh, what did they call them again? Ah yes...
The Eyes of Heaven...
!!
Oh my...
It's tails...
Hey. You can't just go wandering off by yourself like that. You might run into an anomaly assassin...
Ahh...
You!! You're...Darby!!
Jolyne! Get away from him!
It's too late now...I'm claiming my prize!
You made a bet, remember? You bet me your soul!
Ah!
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
Betting makes it easier to pull people's souls out from their bodies. And my Stand has the power to capture them!
But I suppose I don't need to explain that to you, Jotaro...
Both sides are tails... Talk about a cheap trick.
A cheap trick was all it took. Unlike her father, she was quite a careless young girl...
...
You've got guts, Darby. I'll give you that.
I see you've even got your deck of cards ready.
...
Looks like you want me to beat you at poker once again. Am I right?
...
Jotaro...
I lost to your bluff back then...
I was so humiliated... I'll never forget it! I've never been so ashamed in my entire life...
I just couldn't forgive myself...
I cursed myself for suffering that mental defeat!
I will never revert to the pathetic Darby I once was! Never again!
The Noble One didn't send me here!
No, I have come to fight with you to reclaim my honor as a gambler!
Jotaro! Duel me in poker once more! I'll bet your daughter's soul on it!
Fine...
Say it, then.
...
I'll bet my own soul.
Good!
OK! OPEN THE GAME!
Let's begin!
Urrgh...
Looks like Jolyne's soul is back.
You lose, Darby.
Heh heh... Impressive.
I stole your daughter's soul, and you stole it back. Now we're even.
You've gotta be kidding me. You really think I'm just going to let you leave now?
Of course. That's exactly what I think. You've let countless enemies escape up until now, haven't you?
That's it!
Jotaro. I feel very, very good right now...
I have confirmed that you are just as powerful as you ever were.
So, I will give you just one warning...
If you meet the Noble One, you mustn't fight him!
If you do, all trace of you will be wiped away from this world. Not even your soul will remain.
...
I want to extract your soul and add it to my collection.
That's why I'm warning you...
Farewell, JoJo. I hope we'll meet again.
Mmmnn...
I-I lost... I lost that bet...
Gimme a break...
But... That overwriting reality thing...
I still have no idea what kind of an ability it could be.
Your abilities will never be able to stand up to the Noble One...
Is this that overwriting reality thing again?
Oh?
You know the secret of the Noble One's Stand?
No... I doubt that words alone would allow you to understand the true meaning...
The true meaning of overwriting reality, and ceasing to exist in a world...(22050)
