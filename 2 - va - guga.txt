(20599)Itália -2001-
Como filho de DIO, Giorno Giovanna também herdou o sangue da família Joestar.
Depois de se tornar membro da gangue Passione, seu senso de justiça o tornou uma espécie de rebelde.
Depois de perder muitos aliados,
ele derrotou o chefe da gangue, Diavolo, em uma violenta batalha.
Onde estamos?
O Coliseu!
Você aprende essas coisas depois de viajar tanto quanto eu. Sim, Eu tenho certeza disso. É o mundialmente conhecido Coliseu da Itália!
Então teleportamos do Egito para a Itália?
E não é só isso. Olhe ao seu redor. Não lhe parece uma época diferente?
Hã? Cadê todo mundo?
Hmm...
Parece que eles foram para outro lugar.
O quê?
Quando muitas pessoas entram juntas numa fenda de luz, elas as vezes param em locais um pouco distantes.
Don't worry, though. The locations are never too far apart. I'm sure they're just a stone's throw away.
Let's take a walk around the Coliseum and see if we can find them.
Oh, but before that, let me explain something.
Whenever the corpse fixes an anomaly, it gains resonance power.
So if you find someone who's been caught up in an anomaly...
Be sure to liberate them with your corpse part, just like I did before.
Following the Holy Corpse's guidance is the quickest way to assemble it.
Gimme a break. Why didn't you say so sooner?
Hm? That's...
We finally...did it...
We did it, right? We won! Finally!
Bucciarati's got his soul back now, but his body is injured!
He must be dying to find out what happened to us in the Coliseum!
Come on, Giorno! Let's fix up Bucciarati and head back home!
Yeah... Let's go...
I'll be...right there...
?
Mista? Trish? Where are you?
They're gone! But they were here just a minute ago...
Heh...
Ah!
Bucciarati! You're okay?!
And here I was thinking your soul had already passed on...
I captured Mista and Trish. With my zippers, of course...
Now, Giorno...I just need you to die, and all my problems will be solved!
Zipper Man!
Gggh?!
Just now!
I touched him with Golden Wind and felt an incredible life force come gushing out of him!
I don't know why, but...this is someone else!
This Bucciarati...is not the same Bucciarati as before!
I will exterminate everyone who is capable of interfering with the Noble One!
The Noble One...? What are you talking about?
Gimme a break...
Looks like one of those anomalies is happening right in front of us...
Who is that?
Must be a tourist...
Get back, unless you want to get hurt. This is a world that members of the public don't need to know about.
Oh yeah? And what kind of a world would that be? Do tell.
I...warned you!
Zipper...!
Oraaaa!
Burrgh!
You're a...Stand User too?!
And a powerful one at that! You can punch faster than Zipper Man!
How dare you...
So you're...a Stand User as well?!
What power...what speed... It'd be too dangerous to take you head-on!
I'll leave you to the other two...
The other two?
Bucciarati!
He disappeared?!
Looks like he got away.
!
Is that...? It can't be! That looks like Narancia's Li'l Bomber!
A new Stand?
Find Narancia!
But I thought Narancia was dead!

Tch! How'd you get in so close?!
Narancia!
F...Fugo! You too?
Prepare yourself, Giorno...
You want to fight together, Fugo? You want to team up Li'l Bomber and Purple Smoke?!
Hey. You're a Stand user too, right?
Lend me a hand. We've got to get these guys back to normal.
I'm Jotaro Kujo. What's your name?
Giorno...Giovanna...
My virus will free you from your pain...
Two beehives, coming right up!
We can turn them back to normal? How?
I'll explain later. First we need to stop them.
Time to die, Giorno!
Fugo... What are you doing here?
You're not half bad.
What a Stand... It has both overwhelming power and super-precise movements...
If you catch this virus...you're done for. There's no cure.
You're both going straight to hell!
Very well...
Urgh...
He's too strong... I can't believe someone like him exists! I can't let him get any closer...
I need to escape and rethink my plan!
Please! Wait, Fugo!
He's gone!
Guess we lost him. At least we got one.
H-Huh? What's going on? ...Giorno?
Narancia! You know who I am?
W-What was I just doing?
Jotaro!
What just happened here?
I found one of those anomalies.
Hm?
Look!
I guess it's telling me to chase after those two.
Gramps, Kakyoin, keep an eye that guy.
We'll chase after the pair who escaped inside the light. You coming?
This will lead us to Bucciarati?
Very well. Let's go!
This is...Neapolis Train Station!
We moved from the Coliseum to Neapolis Train Station?!
They must be around here somewhere. Let's hurry up and find them.
Search the stage!
Is that...
Oh, Jotaro! I found you!
What are you doing here, Jean Pierre?
And what's that?
This turtle? It was on the other side of the platform!
I thought if I left it there, someone might step on it, so I brought it over here to the water fountain.
Jotaro, what's going on?
Who is that?
This is Giorno Giovanna. He got caught up in this era's anomalies.
(I feel like I've seen this guy before somewhere... Hmmm...)
Let me introduce you, Giorno. This is... Hm?!
I didn't think you'd chase me this far!
Bucciarati!
You came here through the Light Rifts, didn't you?
I see... You're collecting the Holy Corpse parts too!?
So that's an anomaly. I just need to beat him to a pulp and then shine the corpse's light on him, right?
Yeah, but he's got a close-range power type Stand. Be careful.
Okay! Leave it to me!
Fine! If you want to fight, then so be it! I won't hold back...
And I've called on an ally who won't hold back either!
An ally...?
Jean Pierre...
Wha!! Whaaaat!?
Y-you're...Cool Ice!
What's wrong? Why do you look so surprised...
If you lose your cool...it means you're afraid.
You're...AFRAID of me...aren't you?
Shut the hell up! Jotaro, let me take this guy!
I'll fight with you!
This time, I'll cut you into so many pieces you'll never be able to come back again!
Bucciarati. I'm going to defeat you...for your own sake.
You won't escape this time. I'll stop you no matter what it takes...
Your life ends here, Giorno Giovanna!
Bucciarati... I hope you're "prepared" for this.
You're the ones who should prepare yourselves...prepare to be scattered across the ground in tiny pieces, that is!
You scumbag! I'll slice you into dust as many times as I need to!
Oh no you won't! This time it's your turn to become dust...in my dark void!
Please wake up, Bucciarati!
Now make sure you go to hell this time!
Farewell, Giorno.
Jean Pierre was crushed into tiny pieces...and died...
Your sword...is just as sharp as before...
Heh heh...You know, I like you...
Jean Pierre! My Stand is going to swallow and kill you!
What!? Hey, hold up!
Giorno Giovanna... Your ability truly is dangerous...
But I won't let this happen again...
Bucciarati!
He got away...
Hold on. Was that Cool Ice guy...
Yes! He's the son of a bitch who killed Avdol and Iggy!
The anomalies must have brought him back to life as well! Even though I lured him out into the sunlight and turned him into dust!
Wait. Something isn't right...
I thought DIO's blood had turned him into a vampire...
Which means there's no way he'd be able to stand out here in broad daylight...
Maybe he's actually someone else?
Take Bucciarati, for instance. The man with the zippers...
Logically, his body should have no life energy at all right now...
Yet when we just fought, he was brimming with it.
They're the same, but different! That's the only way to explain it...
Except that doesn't explain anything...
Honestly, we don't really understand what's going on either.
We came here with a guide who's supposed to know what's what, but he's kind of...sketchy.
Look, the Holy Corpse is resonating!
There must be a Holy Corpse part somewhere in this station.
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
The Noble One would be so pleased if I exterminated you...
Enough with the Noble One crap! Who the hell is he?
Heh heh heh...
The only man in the world who I swear allegiance to...
Whaaat?
L-Look!
You've found the Holy Corpse (Head)!
Good, we found the corpse part...
Erm, how many parts of the Holy Corpse were there again?
Speedwagon said there were nine in total.
Sheesh! This is gonna take a while...
Whoa! You found the Holy Corpse part already?!
Sorry it's taken me so long to get here. I found these two by the Coliseum,
and it took me a while to explain the situation.
Giorno!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Mista! Trish!
I see... When Bucciarati disappeared, the zippers must have worn off.
Hey, tell me something. Why did Bucciarati come after us?
And how did Narancia come back to life?
What's going on here? I-I don't remember a thing...
I don't really know myself.
But you do, don't you, Mr...umm...
It's Speedwagon.
Let's save the details for later, shall we? Basically, we're collecting the Holy Corpse parts,
and we need your help!
Please! Lend us your strength!
Let me just ask one thing.
The light from the <color red>Holy Corpse</color> can return Bucciarati and Fugo back to normal...
Correct?
Yes, that's right!
...
Very well. In that case, let us assist you.
What about that turtle?
Oh, yeah, check this out!
I heard about it from Mista and Trish. This turtle's shell is connected to some mysterious space.
Inside is a wide room that can fit several people inside!
If we use this turtle, we can prevent ourselves from getting split up by the Light Rifts!
Just watch! This is how you go in.
He disappeared! Is this some kind of Stand power? Don't tell me the turtle has a Stand too!
Please, wait!
Hm? Me?
It's been bugging me for some time, but I've finally figured it out.
I know who you are!
Who I am? What are you talking about?
You're Jean Pierre the turtle guy, aren't you?
...
Say what now?
He is, isn't he? I was thinking the exact same thing!
Me too! You're the one who switched souls with the turtle!
Switched souls with the turtle!?
You look a lot younger than you did when you were with the turtle, though.
"When I was with the turtle"!?
Now wait one minute here. This isn't making any sense. It almost sounds like you think I turned into a turtle or something...
Is this some kind of Italian joke? Ha ha ha...
Hey... Maybe we shouldn't have mentioned it.
Hmm. Yeah, it's just, there's been so much weird shit happening lately that I've gotten desensitized!
I guess if you think about it logically, turning into a turtle is a pretty shocking thing. Maybe we should have just kept quiet?
G-Giorno... You're the one who brought this up. You fix it!
Very well.
I'm sorry. What I said before was just a figment of my imagination... Please forget about it.
So, Jotaro. We're to get inside the turtle, correct? I'll go in first.
Yeah, all that stuff was just made up.
Sorry about that...
You're never gonna turn into a turtle! Just relax.
Hey, wait a damn minute! You need to explain yourselves clearly, or this is going to bug me forever!
I feel a bit confused myself...
It seems like Jean Pierre and that group have some kind of connection. Their destinies are intertwined somehow...
Gimme a break...
Kakyoin's already inside the turtle.
Now, let's enter the Light Rift.
So...he was guided here by the Holy Corpse...
