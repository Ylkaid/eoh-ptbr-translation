Not bad, kid.
We're out of time! Are you sure we'll be okay here?!
Stroheim!!
Stop your bleating, old man!
Gramps!!
That old man never fails!
We're just getting started!
I'm getting antsy!
I'm thinking up so many ways to torture you right now!
All right, now you've done it!!
Don't give up!
OH MY GOD!
Nice one!
Good! Very good!
Wow!
Hey! Now's not the time for a cat nap!
Awesome!
We've still got a ways to go...
Don't panic!
It's finally time for the climax!
The fight's only just begun!
You okay?!
Nice!
Nice!
I knew you could do it!
Jonathan!!
You won!
Stop trying to hurry me!!
Wake up, you goon!
Nice one!
I don't need you to tell me that!
You've really grown, Caesar!
Nice, nice!
Let's win this, Lisa Lisa!
Lisa Lisa!
She really is awesome!!
I guess being 50 years old has its perks!
Calm the hell down, Stroheim!
Stroheim!!
What, we're not done yet?!
Jotaro! Earth to Jotaro!!
What's wrong, scaredy cat?
Kakyoin!
This is it! Stay focused, Jean Pierre!
Jean Pierre!!
Okay... Not good!
Avdol!
I don't need you to tell me that, old man!
Gramps!!
I'll give you some gum when this is over, Iggy!
Stupid mutt!! What were you thinking?!
Haste makes waste, Josuke!
Josuke! Damn it!
Giorno, stay calm!
Giorno!!
Jolyne! Time to kick some butt!
Jolyne!!
The fun's just starting...
Hurry, hurry!
I'm thinking up so many ways to tease you right now!
Quit screwing with me, dammit!
Fight hard, now, honey!!
Not bad...
Nicely done!
Woo hoo!
Stay guarded!
No panicking, sweetie!
Time for the climax!
Let's go, honey!
You okay, babe?!
That's it!
Oooh!
Mm-hmm!
You won, sweetums!
Stop trying to hurry me!!

Help me out, Caesar!
How rude!
Caesar, what are you panicking for?!
Show me what you've got, paisano!
You moron!
Ooh, not bad!
Now you're looking handsome!
So sexy!
Caesar? Caesar, wake up!
We won it, Caesar!
Nice, nice!
Let's give them a show, Lisa Lisa!
Lisa Lisa!!
Oh, baby!
I guess being 50 years old has its perks!
Stay calm! Calm, you hear me?!
This is taking longer than it should...
The true battle begins here, babe!
Keep that noggin focused!
Cut it out already! C'mon!
I know, I know!
Time for the last push!
Whoa! Did they knock you out?!
We've still got a chance to win!
Final attack!
Seems like you're having trouble out there.
Now I'm getting serious!
Where'd all that time go?
I'm not finished yet.
This is really turning out to be a pain in the neck...
Stop acting like a baby!
This is quite unlike you...
Got the hang of it now?
That's how you do it!
Excellent!
I'll finish the rest!!
You survived that? Good for you.
It's our turn now!
Let's win this!
Please allow me the honor!
Are you okay?!
Just try to hang on!
What a man!
Perfect rhythm!
Excellent!
How dare you?! Nooo!
Amazing! I should have known!
Let's finish this, thug!
Speedwagon!!
We can't let this drag on...
Fix up your rhythm!
I'll do something about them!
JoJo, you son of a...
Nice one, JoJo!
Just shut up!
I'm not the least bit panicked!
Silence, you freak!
Allow me to assist you!
Are you okay?!
Let me handle this!
Lisa Lisa?! No!!
Amazing!
Let's win this, JoJo!
This is quite unlike you...
Just leave this to me and step down!
Get yourself together, moron!
Nice one, JoJo!
I don't want to waste any more time with you.
You're one tough cookie...
I can still fight!
I need to turn this around!
I've taken a lot of hits...
I can't let this happen!
Okay!
That's it!
That's it!
(sigh)
Fine work!
Let's hurry up and end this.
Let's hurry!
Okay! I'll cover for you!
I keep getting attacked!
We'll be in danger unless we turn this around!
You're truly incredible.
That's the spirit!
Fantastic!
I don't believe this!
Marvelous!
We're having a tough time here...
Speedwagon!
Time to go on the attack, JoJo!
Be careful!
JoJo, get back!
JoJo!!
Let's end this, Caesar!
Don't chase the enemy too far!
Leave the rest to me!
Caesar!!
Heh... I feel like I can really count on you now.
You're taking too much damage!
Step back and leave this to me!
JoJo?! Ahh!!
That's enough warming up...
Hm?! They've cornered me?!
Not bad.
Nwahh!!
I can still fight!
It appears we're facing a powerful warrior here.
Hoh...
Good.
I respect that attack of yours.
WHAT?!
You won?
Lord Esidisi, enough with the games, please.
How hurt are you?
That's not enough to surprise me.
Excellent form, master!
That was wonderful.
Lord Esidisi!!
I expected no less of you, Lord Esidisi.
Let's not waste any more time here.
I think we've toyed with them enough.
Please accept my apologies, Lord Kars. I'll finish this immediately!
How hurt are you?
Allow me to handle this!
That's not enough to surprise me.
Excellent form, master!
That was wonderful.
Lord Kars!!
I expected no less of you, Lord Kars.
Now the true battle begins.
They aren't making this easy on us.
Not too shabby!
What's wrong with me?!
You can still fight, yes?
Things are looking grim.
Hoh...
Skillful!
Allow me to commend you.
What?!
You won?
Hmm... Time to end this.
Still warming up, huh?
Nice form, Wamuu!
Always impressive.
Wamuu!!
Well done, Wamuu!
Relax, we're almost finished here.
You're in good form today, Kars.
Excellent!
Kars...
It's about time, Kars!
They can fight...
This is taking a while...
Perhaps I underestimated them.
AH... AH...
Did you let your guard down?
You sure let them have their way with you.
You're no amateur!
Not bad.
You've redeemed yourself!
Useless trash!
Oh, you won?
Wamuu, you don't look so good...
Still playing around, are we?
Nice form, Wamuu!
I'm always counting on you.
He was far too pure-hearted to be a fighter!
That's my Wamuu...
Looks like you're having trouble.
Hmm...
Well done, Esidisi.
I see you're in good spirits today.
Esidisi!
That's more like it, Esidisi!
They can fight...
This is taking a while...
Perhaps I underestimated them.
AH... AH...
Did you let your guard down?
You sure let them have their way with you.
You're no amateur!
Not bad.
You've redeemed yourself!
Useless trash!
Oh, you won?
Wamuu, you don't look so good...
Still playing around, are we?
Nice form, Wamuu!
I'm always counting on you.
He was far too pure-hearted to be a fighter!
That's my Wamuu...
Looks like you're having trouble.
Hmm...
Well done, Esidisi.
I see you're in good spirits today.
Esidisi!
That's more like it, Esidisi!
This war's just getting started!
They're more powerful than I thought!
I'm still in one piece!
Inconceivable!
Do you enjoy getting hurt?
Grin and bear it!!
YES!
Just what the "Doktor" ordered!!
Praiseworthy!
How could you let them do that?!
I never doubted you.
Silence, you filthy Brit!
Wait, you hoodlum!!
So you CAN fight!
This war's just getting started, JoJo!
You still haven't beaten them yet?!
JoJo!! Time's a-wasting!!
JoJo!!
I knew I could count on you, JoJo!
Just give up while you still can...
They're stronger than I thought...
I couldn't dodge all of that...
You're gonna pay for this!
This is nothing to worry about.
Tch... Don't push yourself too hard, okay?
Good.
I think that did the trick.
Wow... Impressive.
Dammit!
You won that one.
I didn't think we'd have to work this hard...
Hey, you're not allowed to die yet!
Alright already!
Open your eyes, Kakyoin!
Not bad, Kakyoin.
This one's tough... Josuke, back me up.
What are you lying down for? Get up!
Well done, Josuke.
Yeah, let's show 'em what we're really made of!
Hey, Jonathan!
I knew I didn't need to worry.
Damn... Enough is enough!
Avdol! Hang in there!
I foresaw that, Avdol.
Tch... This has gone on for too long.
Hey, stay on your feet, Jean Pierre!
Nice one, Jean Pierre.
Heh.
Gramps... Just get behind me, okay?
...Gramps...
Not bad for an old man.
You're a sly one, I'll give you that.
Iggy, it's time to finish this.
Hey, no one told you to lie down!
I got some gum with your name on it...
Tch... These guys won't go down easy...
Koichi, don't overdo it now!
You're stronger than I thought, Koichi.
I didn't think it'd take this long...
Stop goofing around... Hey, Okuyasu!
That's what I like to see, Okuyasu.
Stop holding me back...
Hey, get up, Rohan!
Just watch that pen go...
Tch... They know what they're doing.
Giorno... C'mon!
Damn, kid.
Tch... Why are we having this much trouble?
Hey! Get up right now!
Guess you can fight a little.
Gimme a damn break...
It's about time we wrapped this up!
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
Nice one, Ermes.
Are they really this tough?
Anastasia! Hang in there!
Hmph... Not bad, I guess.
Just give up while you still can...
They're stronger than I thought...
I couldn't dodge all of that...
You're gonna pay for this!
This is nothing to worry about.
Tch... Don't push yourself too hard, okay?
Perfect hit.
That's how you do it!
Wow!
Dammit!
You won that one.
I didn't think we'd have to work this hard...
Hey, you're not allowed to die yet!
That was some quick thinking there.
Alright already!
Open your eyes, Kakyoin!
Not bad, Kakyoin.
Stay firm, Josuke.
Did the pressure get to you?!
I knew I could count on you.
Yeah, let's show 'em what we're really made of!
Hey, Jonathan!
I knew I didn't need to worry.
Damn... Enough is enough!
Avdol! Hang in there!
I foresaw that, Avdol.
Tch... This has gone on for too long.
Hey, stay on your feet, Jean Pierre!
Nice one, Jean Pierre.
Heh.
Gramps... Just get behind me, okay?
...Gramps...
Not bad for an old man.
You're a sly one, I'll give you that.
Iggy, it's time to finish this.
Hey, no one told you to lie down!
I got some gum with your name on it...
Tch... These guys won't go down easy...
Koichi, don't overdo it now!
You're stronger than I thought, Koichi.
I didn't think it'd take this long...
Stop goofing around... Hey, Okuyasu!
That's what I like to see, Okuyasu.
Stop holding me back...
Hey, get up, Rohan!
Just watch that pen go...
Tch... They know what they're doing.
Giorno... C'mon!
Damn, kid.
Tch... Why are we having this much trouble?
Hey! Get up right now!
Guess you can fight a little.
Gimme a break...
It's about time we wrapped this up!
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
Nice one, Ermes.
Are they really this tough?
Anastasia! Hang in there!
Hmph... Not bad, I guess.
We've only just begun!
Wow, they've still got some fight left in them?
These wounds aren't fatal...
No... I can't lose here!
You're fine!
We've still got a chance here!
Good one!
I knew you were powerful.
That went perfectly!
N-No way!
We've won!
They aren't half bad.
I see this is taking some time...
Uh-oh. Are you sure we can win this?
You'll be fine!
We haven't lost this yet!
Splendid.
That's it!
Marvelous!
Mr Joestar... How?!
You just sampled Mr Joestar's true power!
They aren't amateurs...
Taking our time, are we?
We can only rely on our mental strength now, Jotaro!
Are you all right?
We've still got a chance here!
Impossible! They got Jotaro?!
I never doubted you, Jotaro.
But you can't use your fists in sumo...
We can't underestimate them.
This is one long battle.
This is taking forever.
Avdol! It can't be!
That flame Stand is so powerful!
I won't give up here!
Don't try to sacrifice yourself!
Amazing sword work!
I can't believe it's taking us so long...
Mr Joestar! How?!
You never fail!
Just a little more!
Iggy!!
Good boy!
Tch! Don't they ever give up?
I can't lose here!
I took the brunt of that!
This could be a problem!
Hey, you okay?
Step back! Leave this to me!
Nice!
Whoa!
Bravo!
Why did you have to die near me?!
We won!!
Save the lecture for later!
Mr Joestar!
I knew I could count on you!
Hey hey hey! Jotarooo!
What the?! Jotaro!
That's more like it, Jotaro!
You're no match for us!
It's me and you until the end here, Kakyoin!
Kakyoin!!
What a versatile Stand!
Hey... Is this ever going to end?
Avdol!!
Don't burn me up, too!
Not in a million years!
They just don't quit!
Don't push yourself too hard!
I'll handle the rest!
Mr Joestar!
I knew I could trust in you!
Sorry, I didn't think it'd take this long...
Iggy!!
I'll give you some gum later!
It's about time you helped out!
Let's win this, Giorno!
Giorno! Hey!
You've really got some guts, kid!
Don't give up, Bucciarati!
Bucciarati! How?!
I'd never wanna mess with those zippers!
This...could be bad...
Narancia?! Hey!
Not bad for a shrimp!
What's all this turtle talk about?!
Mista! Bullets!
I used to hate gun-based Stands, you know!
How about a date when this is over?
Trish... I'm sorry!
Even when you fight, you look cute!
Perhaps we need to speed up a bit.
They're tough...
I can still fight!
Things are looking bad!
Just don't overdo it!
Don't give up!
Excellent.
Hm, not bad.
Impressive!
W-Wake up!
That was a magnificent battle!
We've still got some work left to do.
They aren't making this easy on us.
Keep fighting, Mr Joestar!
Don't strain yourself!
Please, don't give up yet!
That did the trick.
Nicely done.
Impressive.
Mr Joestar!
Such skill!
Jotaro, don't do anything rash!
Jotaro lost?!
Heh... You always come through.
I didn't know you were this strong!
Hang in there, Kakyoin!
Cool and calculated.
We've wasted a lot of time here.
I told you not to get cocky!
Flawless swordplay!
You thought you could beat us?
Yes! It's our turn now!
Ahh! Mr Joestar!
Old age has made you even fiercer!
Yes!
Iggy! Now's our chance!
Iggy... No!
I'll give you some treats later.
Mm, they've done this before.
This is taking too long.
I'm taking too much damage...
I can take this...
Don't panic!
Things are looking dire.
Niiice!
YES!
You're that strong?
Oh no! How?!
Looking good!
Just look at that fighting spirit!
No... Grandpa!
So that's how Jonathan Joestar fights!
This is taking a while...
I knew this was going to happen!
I can't believe you made it this far!
No more screwing around, you hear me?!
I lost?!
That's how Joseph Joestar rolls!
Lend me a hand, Caesar!
Caesaaaaaar!
Beautiful moves, as usual!
Let's show them how much more experienced we are!
Lisa Lisa! Stand up!
As merciless as ever!
(wheezing)
J-Jotaro!!
That's my grandson!
Hee hee hee hee!
Never stop thinking of victory, Kakyoin!
Kakyo...in...
They never notice Hierophant until it's too late...
Focus, Jean Pierre!
Jean Pierre, open your eyes!
Slice and dice!
Don't give up!
A-Avdol!
I'm starting to feel a little crispy myself!
Now let's go get some grub!
Let's go, Iggy!
Whew, I'm really getting tired here...
Josuke! I-I'm...
Talk about GREAT!
Am I cool or what?
Save the whining for later!
Okuyasu! Chin up!
Shaving space... What a frightening power!
Just stay strong until the end!
Koichi! You okay?!
Now you're looking like a real man!
Let's hurry up and finish this, Rohan!
Rohan, look alive!
Just watch that pen go...
Time for the finisher, Giorno!
Giorno?! But how...
What an efficient fighting style!
You're not gonna give up, are you?
J-Jolyne!!
She's way more powerful than I thought!
Talk about a couple of pests!
You're gonna pay for this!
I'm still rarin' to go!
I think this is it for me...
Whoa, are you kidding me?
We're dead meat. Run for it!
Not bad, I guess.
Guess you CAN fight!
Wow! You redeemed yourself!
Hey, you're not done fighting yet!
Guess that's that.
Grrr, woof woof!
Grrr, woof woof!
Woof! Ruff!
Woof! Woof woof!
Woof woof! Howl!
Howl!
Howl!
Still hanging on, are we?
Just die already!
Even your attacks are utter trash...
You dare push DIO this far?!
You're taking damage!
Hmph... You're useless.
Hmph... You're nothing special.
Ooh, not bad.
I have faith in you...
You know, I had faith in you...
Well done.
Don't hold me back, JoJo!
Pathetic, JoJo!
Of course we won...
Don't worry.
Pathetic, Dio!
You really thought you could defeat I, DIO?!
WREYYYYY!
When are you going to get around to killing them, Hol Horse?
I thought you were a bit better than this...
Well done, Hol Horse.
I can't believe they're giving you so much trouble.
Not even you could stop them?
Your void is invincible!
Time for the real fun to begin, N'doul!
N'doul... How could you let that happen?
Your Stand never fails.
What's the hold up, Mariah?
Looks like you got too close to the enemy.
Pull in victory to us, Mariah!
Having trouble, Animal Shop?
Guess you're just another bird after all.
Excellent work, Animal Shop!
You're such a disappointment.
Hmph... Is that all you've got?
Giorno... You intrigue me.
Not bad, kid.
Time to finish them, Pucchi!
You're taking damage!
Tsk!
Am I really going to lose you here?
You're my friend for a reason.
Flawless instincts, friend.
Tch! They're tougher than they look...
How long are they gonna keep this up?
Tch... You'll regret that!
I can't beat this guy!
zat all you got?
Hang in there, buddy...
I felt that one!
I knew I could count on you, partner!
You didn't miss a beat!
Let's run for now and wait for a better chance!
We're the unbeatable duo!
I'll finish this up in a jiffy...
S-Sorry, Lord DIO...
(panting)
You alright there?
We might be in trouble here...
Bullseye!
So this is Lord DIO's power...
Guess that's why we call him LORD Dio...
Lord DIO?! Are you kidding me?!
You did it, Lord DIO!
I never doubted you, Lord DIO!
Good! You know what you're doing!
You're the best, baby!
Aw crap...
We've got perfect chemistry!
Good! You know what you're doing!
You're the best, baby!
Aw crap...
We've got perfect chemistry!
Good! You know what you're doing!
You're the best, baby!
Aw crap...
We've got perfect chemistry!
Good! You know what you're doing!
You're the best, baby!
Aw crap...
We've got perfect chemistry!
Good! You know what you're doing!
You're the best, baby!
Aw crap...
We've got perfect chemistry!
Good! You know what you're doing!
You're the best, baby!
Aw crap...
We've got perfect chemistry!
Crafty little creatures...
Why are we having so much trouble?!
Just what do you take me for?!
You'll pay dearly for this!
Stop playing around...
Shut your mouth and move back.
That's what I want to see.
Not bad.
Please...dedicate that power to Lord DIO...
Hmph... Useless!
Everything for Lord DIO...
I see. They can take a beating.
Enough is enough! Hurry up and die already!!
Please accept my deepest apologies...
Please do not push yourself, sir!
Please, step back! I'll handle this!
Of course...
So dazzling!
Lord DIO... Such power!
Lord DIOOOO!
That's what you get for defying Lord DIO...
Don't you ever learn?
You know how to fight...
I can still move!
Is this the end of the line?!
At this rate, you'll be dead soon.
You're taking too many hits...
Hmph... Commonplace.
Not bad, I suppose.
Well played.
You died because you're weak...
Heh heh... Finally, someone reliable.
We aren't the only veterans here.
Lord DIO, are you feeling okay?
I can hear Lord DIO's joyous reverberations...
Whatever you do, please don't push yourself.
P-Please step back!
I will always believe in you, Lord DIO.
What skillful moves!
This is Lord DIO's power!
Lord DIOOOO!
Heh heh. Only fools defy Lord DIO...
Urgh! They're still standing?!
How can they still be alive?!
This isn't even worth mentioning.
This is humiliating!
How pathetic...
Maybe it was a mistake to pair up with you...
Guess you got lucky this time?
That was pretty good.
You're amazing!
What are you doing on the ground?!
You're pretty handsome.
I-I'm almost finished, sir...
I'll win, whatever it takes!
I-I'm so sorry!
Please don't overdo it, sir!
How dare you?! You'll pay for that!
Perfect!
That was amazing, Lord DIO!
I never knew you were this mighty...
Lord DIO?! Lord DIO!!
Of course Lord DIO won... Heh heh heh.
Caaaaaw!
Ngggh...
Kee kee kee...
GUGAGA...
Caaaaaw!
Caw caaaw!
GUGA!
Caaaaaaaw!
Caw caw caaaaw!
Gghyaah!
Ngggh...
Caw! Caaaaw!
Nnhgggh...
Caw caw, caw caw!
Gggh...
Kee kee kee!
Caaaaaaaw!
Caw caw caaaaw!
Ggggh...
Ggh ggh ggh!
It's about time we attacked!
What a pain in the neck...
That didn't feel too good...
These wounds look bad!
You okay?!
Hang in there, man!
Nice one!
Perfect!
Great!
Hey, are you okay?!
We won!
Looks like time's up!
That's gonna leave a mark...
Put on your game face, now!
Teamwork!
GREAT!
For real?!
No way!
We won!
Time's almost up, Mr Joestar!
Hooray for mind games!
They're not as lame as they look...
Hey old timer, you okay?
Gramps?!
You really used to be strong, Mr Joestar...
Holy crap!
Time to kick it into high gear, Koichi!
Hey, Koichi! Snap out of it!
That's why you're my buddy!
You never fail me, man!
Wait, Okuyasu! Don't lose your cool!
Okuyasu! Come ON!
You could never beat us!
You'd better not forget who we are!
You're just getting bored of this, aren't you?!
Rohan?! Crap!
Whew... It's so hard to work with you.
The hell is your problem?!
Stop pushing the blame onto other people!
Sh-Shigechi?!
Yeah! You da man, Shigechi!
Yeah, time to finish this!
Giorno! Hang in there!
Great job! Thanks for watching my back!
Whew, this is tiring...
M-Miss Jolyne?!
We're just too strong for you!
Just give up while you still can...
These two are trouble...
I got hit?
This is bad...
Hey, get it together.
Don't give up!
Huh...
Not bad.
You're something else.
You're down for the count?!
Impressive.
Gramps, charge!
Hey... Hey, Joseph!
Not bad, gramps.
Let's win this, Kakyoin.
Wake up, Kakyoin!
Calm as usual, I see.
Josuke, back me up.
Thanks a lot, Josuke...
Well done, Josuke.
Full speed ahead!
Hey, Jonathan!
I wasn't worried.
Alright, alright.
Do you have a fever, Avdol?
Your flames are as fierce as ever.
Tch... This has gone on for too long.
No... Jean Pierre!
Speed always was your forte.
Heh.
Gramps... Don't push your luck here.
You're not allowed to kick the bucket yet!
Heh... Impressive for an old man.
You're a sly one, I'll give you that.
Don't strain yourself.
Iggy... Hey, Iggy!
The simpler the Stand, the stronger it is.
Heh... True.
Koichi! Get up!
You've gotten stronger, Koichi.
I can't believe this is taking so long.
Wake up, Okuyasu!
See, you just need to use your head a little.
What's taking so long?
Get the hell up!
Your Stand's strong when it actually works...
They know how to take their hits...
Giorno... C'mon!
That was amazing for a kid your age.
How are they giving us this much trouble?
J-Jolyne!
She's so strong-willed...
Gimme a break...
Gimme a break... Calm down.
Stop screwing around!
Those stickers are pretty handy.
Seems like things aren't going your way.
I told you not to do anything rash...
Your strength is the real thing.
We need to beat them before they exhaust us!
Y-you really think we can win?
Urgh, this is bad...
I'm not gonna lose here!
Are you okay?!
Feels like we're gonna lose here!
Nice!
W-Wow!
You're really that strong?!
No!!
You did it!
"Watch carefully," okay?!
Are you alright?!
Stay with me!
Nice job!
As strong as ever!
Stunning!
No way... Jotaro...
You were always this strong?
We can win as long as we don't give up!
Mr Joestar!
Guess you've always been a man of your word!
Keep fighting until the end, Josuke!
No way! Josuke!
Yeaaaah! I knew you'd do it!
Heh heh heh!
Can we really beat them?
Okuyasu!!
That hand of yours is really scary...
I know how much you hate to lose, Rohan...
R-Rohan! Please wake up!
Heaven's Door is so overpowered!
Always so pushy!
Yeah! Thanks, Yukako!
Yukako? Yukako!
What's this feeling I'm getting?
She's so tough...
Don't run away from me this time!
See what happens when you do bad things?!
I guess at the end of the day, you are pretty reliable.
Fine, dammit, have it your way!
Just keel over already!
Oww! That hurt!
Aw crap, I got hit!
Hey, you okay?
Stop helping them kill us!
Whoa, nice!
Woo hoo!
Daaaaaamn!
Hey, this isn't a slumber party!
Yeaaah! We won!
Hop to it, man!
Jotaro?! For real?!
No one can beat Star Platinum!
This still isn't over yet?!
Mr Joestar?!
Smooth one, Mr Joestar!
I can't take it anymore! I'm chargin' in!
H-Hurry up and heal me!
I'm getting a bad feeling here, Josuke...
You sure you can heal all that?!
Josuke, you don't look so good!
Josuke... Hey, Josuke!!
You could never beat us, moron!
You'd better not forget who we are!
Thinking just wastes time, Koichi!
That hurt, dammit!
Oh man, I'm in big trouble here...
C'mon Koichi, you can do better than that!
Forget it, just get outta the way!
Koichi!!
Show 'em how it's done, Koichi!
Can't believe we're doing this bad...
Shigechi! Don't you die on me!
That's what I'm talking about, Shigechi!
Yes, I can picture this now!
I can't wait to turn this into a manga...
True power is born from crisis... That's the basis of all action manga!
Don't you mock Rohan Kishibe!
What, are you tired already?
Completely unreliable...
Satisfactory!
Excellent!
That moved me!
Hey, snap out of it!
I'm here. Of course you won.
Please don't blame this on me...
Jotaro...lost?
Your power is legendary.
Why are we letting them waste our time like this?
...You okay?
Keep that up, and you'll be a dead man!
Nicely done!
Marvelous!
Awe-inspiring!
Mr Joestar?! Hang in there!
That one must have a wealth of experiences just waiting to be read!
...You take care of the rest.
Imbecile! Get back on your feet, Josuke!
I really can't stand you!
Hmph!
I don't like to let other people control me.
Looking good, Koichi!
Amazing!
I respect you!
Koichi?! But...how...
They never stood a chance.
Don't you think we make a good team?
Y-you're startin' to annoy me!
I'm getting sleepy...
You'll be sorry!
I'm not gonna lose...
You got hit again...
P-Pay attention!
You did it!
That was pretty good!
You're super strong!
Hey, it's not naptime!!
Victoryyy!
I already did my part, Josuke...
Josuke?! Josuke!
We did it! We won!
You fought hard too, Okuyasu!
Okuyasu... Be strong!
You only won 'cuz of me!
Just knock it off already!
I'm gonna shock you 'till you drop!
I was just goofing around!
Gotta get serious now!
Whoa, not cool!
Heinous!
Killer.
Whew! Electric!
Knock 'em out!
What?! You let them beat you?!
Gah hah hah hah! You did it!
Now I'm pissed!
Stop getting in my way!
I'm fine! Totally fine!
How dare you?!
You think you can win with those wounds?
Come on, get serious!
So what?
Ooh, impressive.
You've redeemed yourself a bit!
Wake up!
I think I'll excuse myself here.
Such pests!
Koichi, I'm going to win this for us!
You don't need to worry, Koichi! I'm right here with you!
How dare you touch Koichi?!
You're going to pay dearly for that!
Good boy!
You're so skilled, Koichi!
So...dreamy...
No... K-Koichi...
Our hearts beat as one...
Love is invincible!
This isn't over yet?!
Grrr, this is really pissing me off!
I'm not done yet!
I can't believe I'm having trouble with someone like YOU!
You've got to be kidding me...
I've had enough! Switch with me!
Mooore!
You can do better than that!
Hmph! Not bad.
Wake up!
I think I'll excuse myself here.
Such pests!
Koichi, I'm going to win this for us!
You don't need to worry, Koichi! I'm right here with you!
How dare you touch Koichi?!
You're going to pay dearly for that!
Good boy!
You're so skilled, Koichi!
So...dreamy...
No... K-Koichi...
Our hearts beat as one...
Love is invincible!
You're the source of my trouble.
I have to kill them now!
I should escape for the time being...
I'll never let them catch me!
You need to work harder.
You're done for...
Huh...
Good work.
You've earned my respect.
Thanks for saving me the trouble...
Now I can sleep soundly again tonight!
If someone were to see us...
Hurry up and eliminate them!
You must not let them catch you!
Did you...die?
Now I can get some quality sleep.
They must die at once...
Death is imminent...
How can this be happening?
Impossible... I...
Hey, I'm counting on you here.
I thought I'd get more use out of you than this...
That's more like it.
Surprising.
I'm glad you're on my side.
Worthless fool!
You'll come in handy... Heh heh heh.
Now I understand why you're so worried...
You good-for-nothing...
Don't die, other me!
You aren't meant to die here!
I knew that destiny was on my side...
I can't keep up with them...
I know I still have a chance to win!
We can't run here!
This is bad...
Are you okay?
I'll take this!
Bene!
As strong as ever!
You're that strong?
Please stay with me!
Well done!
They're really dragging this out...
Jonathan! No!
I'm happy to have fought beside you.
Understood, Mr Joseph.
Mr Joseph!
You did it, Mr Joseph!
The real battle begins now, Jotaro!
No... They actually got you?!
Guess I really can count on you.
I know we can win this!
Jean Pierre!
You used to be this strong?
This will be the turning point...
Mr Joestar! Open your eyes!
So that's what years of experience can do...
Don't you ever shut up?
DIO...
Overwhelming power...
We're out of time... Give it all you've got!
J-Josuke?!
That's it, Josuke!
It's about time we ended this.
They keep hanging on...
Of course! We can't let up!
Are you all right?
Don't push yourself any further.
Wow. Not bad.
Amazing!
You're that strong?
K-Koichi?!
That's one incredible ability you have.
The same goes for you, Bucciarati.
B-Bucciarati!
That was easy, wasn't it?
Arrivederci!
Yes! This is where it really counts, Narancia!
Narancia!!
Li'l Bomber's guns really pack a punch.
You still haven't eliminated your target, Mista.
Mista?! Hold on!
You were definitely prepared for this.
This is the path...
Are you tired, Trish?
Trish! No!
Trish, you did it!
Don't let up until the end, Fugo!
Are you okay, Fugo?!
That virus of yours is truly ferocious...
They're fighting just as hard as we are...
Jolyne!
Your string has infinite possibilities, I see...
Now THIS is an opponent...
They must be getting tired too.
Nice attack!
I can...still move!
Be very careful...
You're getting hit too much!
Masterful!
Good job!
You're pretty strong.
I-Impossible!
What a fight that was.
Are you okay, Jean Pierre?
Did you get hit, Jean Pierre?!
It was a pleasure to fight alongside you...
You never lose your cool.
Giorno?! But how?!
We won, Giorno!
Arrivederci!
We'll be the last ones standing!
Narancia! This can't be happening!
Nice moves out there, Narancia.
Mista... Stay focused!
Hey, Mista! What are you doing?!
Six Bullets really nailed that combo!
You're exhausted... Step back.
T-Trish!!
Your growth is stunning.
The two of us can win this!
Fugo?! They got you?!
I can always trust your intuition.
You're not getting away!
Son of a...
That went a little deep...
I'm really having bad luck today...
Hey, you okay?
Get back, or you'll die!
Nice one!
Seriously?!
You're nuts!
Now's not the time for that crap!
They never stood a chance.
You're as slow as a turtle!
Jean Pierre! Hey!!
A sword and a gun... Not a bad combo, eh?
bout time we finished this!
Dammit, they got me!
Sorry, but I need a heal!
What's wrong, Giorno?
Hurry up and heal those wounds!
C'mon, you should be able to take more than that!
I'll admit it—you're strong, Giorno!
This is the right path for us!
I know, Bucciarati!
Damn that hurts!
Sorry, I took that head on...
Bucciarati, you okay?!
Just leave the rest to me!
Bucciarati!!
We'd never lose to you!
Stop acting like it's all my fault!
That's gonna leave a mark...
If you take another hit like that...
Hey, stop playing around!
Stop being reckless!
Narancia! Dammit!
You blew him wide open!
Can't believe you're acting so tough at a time like this...
Trish?! Why wasn't I protecting her?!
Yes! We won!
It's all or nothing now! Charge!
That didn't feel very good...
No... My mind's fading...
You okay, Fugo?!
Are you out of your mind?! Get back!
Fugo?! You can't be serious!
All in a day's work, eh, Fugo?
What a pain in the butt...
It's about time someone shut you up!
Felt like that one went kinda deep...
Oh no...
That's nothing to worry about!
Y-You'd better not die here!
Sweet!
This is the ultimate stress relief!
Holy crap!!
No way!
You're pretty good!
These guys are nothing, right, Jean Pierre?!
I can't believe they got you...
I knew you were super strong!
No way are we gonna lose! Right, Giorno?!
Giorno! What are you going to sleep for?!
You did it, Giorno!
Yeah! We're gonna win for sure!
No way... Bucciarati...
We did it! We won!
You wasted too much time...
M-Mista? Hey... Hey!!
Let's hurry home and get some grub!
Keep fighting to the very end!
T-Trish!!
Trish, that was awesome!
We're gonna win this together!
F-Fugo! Open your eyes!
There's no way the two of us would ever lose!
I'm getting a little tired...
They're so annoying!
That's all you've got?!
I can't take another hit like that...
Be careful!
You're in serious danger here!
Nice!
Mm-hmm!
You're something else!
No way! Wake up!
Just another wannabe.
Focus on the battle!
Jean Pierre! No!
You were THIS strong?!
I'm fine, thanks!
Giorno?! It can't be!
Giorno... You're so strong.
Ggh... I'm not done yet!
Bucciarati! But...how?!
I learned a lot from that, Bucciarati.
Yes, let's finish this!
Narancia!
Yes! All according to plan!
Yeah! We can't lose here!
A-Answer me, Mista!
We make a surprisingly good team.
I don't want to let this drag on.
There's no way I'll let you escape now!
I'll wipe that cocky grin off your face!
You'll pay for this!
Defend yourself!
Step back before you die!
Very good!
I knew you could do it!
I have a new respect for you now!
How can this be?!
That was a good fight.
Yeah! We'll fight till our last breaths!
Giorno... No!
Giorno... I knew I could trust you.
Never give up!
Impossible! Bucciarati?!
As strong as ever!
Yeah, let's do this, Narancia!
Narancia! Stand firm!
I knew you could do it!
Yeah... Victory is ours!
M-Mista!
Six Bullets really earned their keep!
Not bad, for a couple of small fries.
Don't go getting cocky!
You dare defy me?
I-I won't take a single step back!
You're hurt...
What a disgrace...
Hmph...
Not bad.
Looks like I'll need to eliminate you too.
I was planning to kill you anyway...
Now I can remain on the top!
That was just a warm-up!
This is where it counts!!
I'm fine...
I can take this...
Hang in there!!
I'll take the front line!!
Okay!
That's it!
Not too bad!
You got hit?!
We won!
We need to finish this quick!
Jonathan! No!
No wonder I'm so strong!
Yeah, let's put the final nail in the coffin!
J-Joseph! No!
Nice one, Joseph!
Relax! You've got me, remember?
Dad! No way!
Kickass!
Give me a damn break...
Of course! I'm gonna win this!
You're done already?!
I don't care if you're tired! Come on!
Whoa... Josuke?!
Hell yeah, Josuke!
I don't plan to let up either!
Giorno?! Stay with me!
We won!
We need to get them off our asses!
E-Ermes!!
Ermes, I'm glad I had you with me...
Idiot...
They're pretty tough themselves...
What the... Anastasia?
As long as you're here, I've got no reason to worry.
This is it! Let's go, Weather!
No! Weather!
Weather, you always save my ass...
Thanks!
Tch! Just give up...
Urgh! Time sure does fly!
I'm a little worried now...
I don't have time to worry about pain!
You're taking fire!!
Get back! I got this!
Whoa!
Badass!
Nice one!
They got you?!
Ha ha! Not bad!
Damn, they really want to piss us off!
Hold on, Jolyne!
Jolyne, chill out!
Okay, next!
Gah hah hah hah!
Shut up! You don't get to order me around!
This is embarrassing, man!
Watch out, Anastasia!
Anastasia?! No way!
You're pretty strong.
Just get off my back already!
Jotaro, be careful!
You can't take any more damage than that!
Well done!
They got Jotaro?!
I knew you could do it, Jotaro!
I don't intend to let this drag on.
Damn, don't they ever learn?
I'm not out of the game yet!
This...might be bad...
Hey, you're losing...
Out of the way! It's my turn!
Good.
Good going.
You can fight after all.
Tch. What a waste of space...
You're surprisingly helpful...
Let's finish this.
Just when I got some time alone with Jolyne... Damn it!
Don't give up, Jolyne! We can still win this!
They're really strong.
Jolyne, get back!
Nice!
Yes, that's it!
Jolyne, you're so beautiful...
J-Jolyne!!
Your eyes look so gorgeous right now...
Let's finish this already, Ermes!
Ermes!!
We need to finish this NOW!
How could anyone defeat Weather?!
They aren't letting up.
I thought this would be a lot easier...
It's okay. We've still got a chance!
They aren't playing around here.
Switch out with me!
Splendid.
That's it!
You're truly incredible.
Jotaro?! But how?!
You really are the man...
Just give it up...
This is taking time...
I-I'm still okay to fight.
This isn't going well...
What are you doing?
Get back!
Not bad.
Amazing.
What an attack...
Wh-What?!
That's more like it.
Just give me the signal, Jolyne...
J-Jolyne!!
Always impressive.
Don't mention it...
Yeah, I know.
A-Anastasia! Hey!!
Nice one, Anastasia.
Stop wasting my time...
This ends here!
Prepare yourself, scum...
Damn, you're pissing me off!
Come on, help me here!
Leave this to me and go away!
Whew!
Looking good!
Gah hah hah! That was insane!
Hey, wake the hell up!
Guess you can hold your own.
Yeah, I got this!
I'll make them regret that!
That's more like it.
Don't mention it...
Just shut your mouth!
Hey, stop slacking off!
Perfect!
Time to go all-out.
Let's finish this!
I-I'm still okay...
At this rate, they'll beat us...
What are you doing?!
Leave the rest to me!
Good!
Amazing!
Stunning...
I don't believe this!
Hey, you've got skills!
I know!
J-Jolyne... Hey!
Whew! That's what I like to see!
Don't mention it...
Yeah. Bombs away!
Anastasia... Hey!
Whew! That's what I like to see!
Stop wasting my time...
This ends here!
Prepare yourself, scum...
Damn, you're pissing me off!
Come on, help me here!
Leave this to me and go away!
Whew!
Looking good!
Gah hah hah! That was insane!
Hey, wake the hell up!
Whoa... Not bad.
Yeah, I got this!
I'll make them regret that!
Don't mention it...
Just shut your mouth!
Hey, stop slacking off!
I can't waste any more time here...
Time's up.
I've taken too many hits.
C-Count prime numbers...
Are you okay?
You'll be fine, right?
Hoh...
So far, so good.
Immaculate!
This is a trial.
Keep it up.
You're actually having trouble here?
I didn't expect them to be this formidable...
It's time we ended this, friend.
How unlike you.
I'll take care of the rest.
You're truly blessed.
Yes, that's it!
I want to follow you.
H-How could you lose?
You're a king amongst kings.
Thank you, DIO.
I can't waste any more time here...
Time's up.
I've taken too many hits.
C-Count prime numbers...
Are you okay?

Hoh...
So far, so good.
Immaculate!
This is a trial.
Keep it up.

You're truly blessed.
Yes, that's it!
I want to follow you.
H-How could you lose?
You're a king amongst kings.
Thank you, DIO.
I'm just getting started!
This is taking forever...
Pain's building up...
(panting)
Try dodging some of those!
Switch with me!!
Wow, you're on a roll!
Yes, that's it!
H-How did you do that?!
Waaaaaaah, ah!
Yeah!!
Gyro! Time to turn this battle around!
Don't panic, Gyro!
Gyro, let's hurry up and finish this already!
You're taking too much damage!
Try dodging some of those!


...the best shortcut.
We can't waste any more time here!


The real battle begins here.
Stop prolonging the inevitable!
I'm not finished yet.
Damn, I keep getting hit...
Let me know if you're having trouble!
Hey, you okay?!
That's what I like to see.
More!
Awesome moves!
B-But how?!
Nyo ho ho! My plan was perfect!
Johnny, time to attack!
Damn! They keep hanging on!
Johnny, don't panic!


The long way is always...
I need to end this quickly...
Stop being difficult!
I've taken a few too many hits...
I need to do something...
You can still fight, yes?
Don't go dying on me.
Hmm.
Not bad.
Excellent.
You made an error...
You led him to misfortune...
I don't want to drag this out.
I guess your bark is worse than your bite.
So it seems.
Whining already, are we?
Don't let them kill you.

Your ambition is laudable...
Now the true battle begins.
You've wasted enough of my time!
You think you can defeat me?
How could I be losing?
Do you enjoy getting hurt?
Just get out of here!
Not bad, I guess.
That's more like it.
Surprising...
Sorry...
That's why I partnered up with you.
Guess we'll have to try and finish this all at once here.

Not bad, Mr. President.
Now the true battle begins.
You've wasted enough of my time!
You think you can defeat me?
How could I be losing?
Do you enjoy getting hurt?
Just get out of here!
Hurry up and finish them!
Overwhelm them!
I've won!
Sorry...
That's why I partnered up with you.
Guess we'll have to try and finish this all at once here.

Not bad, Mr. President.
There's no need to panic.
Jerks...
Damn you!
It'll take more than that to kill me!
You keep looking worse and worse!
Keep that up and you're a goner!
Whoa!
Nice one.
Even I felt that one!
You LOST?!
Hey, you're pretty good!
Time to end this!


Stop screwing around, Joshu!!


I just can't hold myself back!
Cocky douchebags!
Th-The screws...
(panting)
Psh, this is nothing!
Oh come on, man!
Anyone can do that.
I guess that was okay.
Hey! Stop getting cocky!!
Y-You gotta be kidding me!
You only did that thanks to me!
Stop...making...fun of me... (panting)
You got lucky!
You're not getting any praise from me!
Just don't get full of yourself, okay?!

Josuke!! You'd better thank me later!
That HURT!!
I can't give up in a place like this...!
What, we're not done yet?!
We can only rely on our mental strength now, Jotaro!
Jotaro, don't do anything rash!
Hey hey hey! Jotarooo!
(wheezing)
Woof! Ruff!
They're not as lame as they look...
"Watch carefully," okay?!
Hop to it, man!
Please don't blame this on me...
The real battle begins now, Jotaro!
Relax! You've got me, remember?
Just get off my back already!
It's okay. We've still got a chance!
I can't give up in a place like this...!
What, we're not done yet?!
We can only rely on our mental strength now, Jotaro!
Jotaro, don't do anything rash!
Hey hey hey! Jotarooo!
(wheezing)
Woof! Ruff!
They're not as lame as they look...
"Watch carefully," okay?!
Hop to it, man!
Please don't blame this on me...
The real battle begins now, Jotaro!
Relax! You've got me, remember?
Just get off my back already!
It's okay. We've still got a chance!
Wh-what the...
Trapped you!
Incredible!
I need to stay strong!
Amazing. Every move he made was perfectly precise!
You're merciless!
Okay, next!
I can feel a firm resolve resonating in her Hamon!
Wh-What on earth?!
What's this?!
That worked well!
Excellent!
Hmm... Not bad.
Well done! Now just keep breathing like that!
You can certainly hold your own, friend!
What...in...the...
He stopped time?!
Fool! You fell for it!
Perhaps I underestimated them.
You have served Dio well. Allow me to commend you!
Hmph! Guess you aren't totally useless.
What the hell?!
What's going on?!
Heh heh! Gotcha!
Crikey...
I knew I could count on you!
Mr Joestar! You're a beast!
Yeaaah!
Whoa! Nice one!
Soldiers are so merciless!
I feel bad for your opponent...
How in the hell...?!
Huh?!
Got ya!
Nice one!
Nice, nice!
Hey, you're pretty strong for a thug!
Nice job, Caesar!
She really is awesome!!
Show 'em how it's done, Stroheim!
I caaan't mooove?!
What?! Oh dear!
So you finally noticed it!
Ooh, nice one!
Nice, nice!
Aww, you came to help me?
You're so gallant, Caesar!
Years of experience really make a difference!
You look so handsome, soldier boy!
I caaan't mooove?!
What's happening?!
Yes! It worked!
Excellent!
Not bad.
I need to win too!
I knew you'd win!!
You're an idiot, but at least you know how to fight when it really matters!
I'm...getting...slower?
What?!
Right into my trap!
That's it!
Excellent!!
What a powerful Hamon!
Yes, JoJo! You just performed your best attack yet!
Caesar! Excellent form!
Did you dress like that just to deceive the enemy?
S-so...weird...
What's the meaning of this?!
You're mine!
Such strength...
Good work!
I see you're merciless as ever, Lord Esidisi!
You looked so brilliant out there, sir!
You looked so brilliant out there, sir!
S...sssnails?!
Huh?!
Open your eyes!
Stunning!
You're pretty good...
Wamuu, leave some for me!
You're just as sharp as ever!
You're just as sharp as ever!
Whaaaat?!
Huh?!
You fell for it...
Wonderful.
You've got some guts...
Heh heh heh... Yes, you're a true warrior!
You toyed with your prey too much, Esidisi!
I'm...getting...slower?!
The ability to control time actually exists?
You're like a butterfly in a spider's web!
Wonderful.
You've got some guts...
Fantastic, Wamuu!
You never fail, Esidisi!
What kind of trickery is this?!
Whaaaat?!
Imbecile!
Well done!!
A fine attack!
Yes, JoJo!!
Your bravery is truly praiseworthy!
You can fight that well in drag?!
Whaaaat...is thiiis?!
You stopped time?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to fall for that.
That wasn't too bad.
You're pretty wild.
Nice work, Kakyoin!
Don't let up, Jean Pierre!
Okay!
Gimme a break... Let me guess, you wanna chalk this up to experience too?
What...the...
No... It can't be!
You fell for it...
That was a great attack.
Now I know I can count on you.
If you're this strong, we'll be fine.
Hm, not bad.
He's completely out of his mind...
Wh...What's...happening?!
What...just happened?
Hadn't you noticed?
So strong...
What an attack...
Yes, Jotaro!
That's it, Jean Pierre!
Well done! But I can't let you have all the fun...
Well done! But I can't let you have all the fun...
I'm...slowing dowwwn?
What just happened?
Yeaaah!
I know I can really count on you!
I knew I could trust in you!
Nice one!
Hey, don't steal all my thunder!
Bravo, Kakyoin!
Bravo!
That was awesome, Mr Joestar!
Whoa! You're really going wild!
My body...feels weird...
What in the hell?
Tsk tsk!
Good work!
Yes, that was a very wise move!
Your Stand is always overflowing with power...
You've become even stronger than when we last fought!

Idiot...
Well done.
Oh well.
See, you can do it if you try hard enough.
Flawless, Cool Ice.
I admire your loyalty.
I was correct to leave this to you.
Good. You did exactly what I hoped you would.
Good, son...
Friends are priceless.

Yes. Don't forget that sensation.

Woo-hoooooo!

You're powerful...
Yes! That was a perfect hit!
Don't let your guard down, or else I'll be in danger!

Something... bizarre is going on!
Don't take it personally.
Obliterated!
Bene! Well done!
That Stand ability is off the charts!
Bene timing!
Please take care of another as well, Mista.
You really went all-out!
What a powerful Stand...
Whyyy...is this happeniiing...
What is this ability?!
You dropped your guard.
Yeah, that's it!
I'm glad you're on my side.
Yeah! Just one more!
Good one, Narancia!
We prepared ourselves for this on a deeper level!
See what happens when you piss off Fugo?
"Soft and fair goes far..."
They're turrrning into snaaails? Not me tooo...!

You fell right into it!
Nice hit!
They asked for it!

You're awesome, Mista!
Nice one!

The trap worked.
That was even more powerful than I expected!
That was amazing!
Utterly forgettable.
Victory is just ahead!
My bodyyy...feels straaange...
You can control time too?!
Fell for it, huh?
That was quite the attack.
You do good work.
Whaaat...diiid...youuu....do to meee...
The hell?!
You're mine!
Nice one!
You're a huge help!
You kick ass, Ermes!
Diver Drive... What a Stand!
I'm counting on you, Weather!
Star Platinum really is invincible!
Whyyy...are these snaaails here?!
Is this...some kind of trick?
Hell yeah!
Nice!
Sock it to 'em!
Good job, Jolyne!
Whoa, you're nuts!
I'm slowwwing...dowwwn...
What the?!
Good...
Good going.
Nice attack.
Yes... Keep showing me those eyes, Jolyne...
Your ability is absolute madness!
So this is why Jolyne's so strong...
Is this your doing?! Weatherrrr!
What...the...
Good...
That's more like it.
Good...
That was a great move.
Just one more...
Theeese...snaaails...
You...stopped...time?!
Just give it up...
I'm glad you're on my side.
Guess you can hold your own.
That's more like it.
Perfect!
It can't beeee!
What...the...
Good!
Excellent attack.
I can always count on you.
Whew! That's what I like to see!
I'm glad you're on my side.
Noooo... These snaaails...
You...stopped...time?!
Just give it up...
I'm glad you're on my side.
Guess you can hold your own.
That's more like it.
Perfect!
It can't beeee!
You...stopped time?
Just as planned.
A divine strike!
Keep it up.
You're truly blessed...
Excellent work, brother.

Bullseye!
Well done...
I knew you could do it.
Nyo-ho! Nice work!
Whaaat the ffff—
What have you done?!
I've trapped you.
That's more like it.
Allow me to commend you.
Your ambition is laudable...
Somethiiing's...nooot...riiiight...
You...stopped time?
Gotcha...
That wasn't bad.
So you aren't useless after all.
Not bad, Mr. President.
S-snails?!
A Stand that can control time?
MUDA...
That's more like it.
Surprising...
Not bad, Mr. President.
S-snails?!
What's this?!
Good times.
Crafty!
Strong...
...You did that? YOU?
Urggh... Whaaat's haaappening...

Thanks!
Cry Cry Dolls!
Oof...
Welcome!
What would my Hamon do to that crazy hair of yours?
Ryaaah!
Sei!
Zryaaaah!
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!
You must be destroyed!
Kaaaaaaaa...
Kaaaaaaaa...
I can feel the pulse of his life! This wine detects Hamon!
Hoo...
Haa...
Th-this can only make me stronger!
What? Another me?
Dio was a part of my youth! And now it's time for me to put that youth behind me!
Dio! I cannot allow you and that power of yours to escape out to the world!
So you're the fiend who created that Stone Mask!
The sabers on his arms are glowing!
Do you know me?
What? Your ancestor?
Our timing is equal! And I can outreach you by 10cm!
Teach me the path of Hamon! I'll bear any pain! I'll endure any trials!
Would you help me train a bit?
I have a goal that's worth losing a measly four fingers over!
Wh-what the? You look a lot like me!
Assist me in my Hamon training!
Let's go! I, Jonathan Joestar, will be the one to defeat you!
I'll take you on!
You put on the Stone Mask and became a vampire too?!
What's with this guy? He's trying to attack me!
Strange... This man reminds me of my father somehow.
You can use Hamon too? Please spar with me!
Dio?! And that body!
Dio... alive?! It can't be!
What peculiar clothes... Are you an Asian?
I'm Jonathan Joestar... What's your name?
This feeling... Dio?
I feel like I know him, somehow...
Did you break out from prison?
Wait, please! I don't want to hurt a woman!
Wh-what in the world...
Assist me in my Hamon training!
Do you...know me?
Ancestor? What are you talking about?
I've never seen that man before... But for some reason, he feels familiar...
Ancestor? Just what are you trying to say?
Grr... I'm not teaming up with you because I want to!
Yes! Let's take them on together!
I'm going to trust you, Dio—for now!
Your...ancestor? Does that mean you're...?
What's that ability you have?
Yes sir! We're going to take them head-on, are we?
Shall I go out first?
Stay calm... I need to keep my breathing under control!
As long as you're with me, I have nothing to fear!!
Why are you in such a hurry?
Reckless as he may seem, Speedwagon is a brave man!
Time to show you the power of the Joestar family!
Ready, Joseph?!
Roger that! Here I go!
No need to get so riled up, Ms Lisa Lisa!
You're saying that I'm the one who led you to Hamon?
You're still young! Now show me that gallant style you're known for!
Careful now, gramps!
Dio... I'll fight together with you just this once!
Dio, is that you?
I may not have a Stand, but I have my Hamon!
Let us join forces here, Josuke!!
I feel like I know you...
Dio? Just what sort of relationship do you and Dio have?
A girl? Stand back, this is dangerous!
I'll act as the decoy!
Time to show you the power of the Joestar family!
Stand down, Joseph! There's no way you could fight a serious battle in that questionable attire!
You've inherited my blood?
Wait, can you use Hamon too?
Count me in too, Jotaro!
Are you a Hamon warrior too?
Dio, you don't belong in this world! It's time to finish you!
You must flee, Speedwagon! There's no reason for you to get dragged into this as well!
I'll cleanse the world of your filth!
Understood!! Mr Zeppeli and I will send both of our Hamon crashing straight into Dio!
Mr Zeppeli!
What in Heaven's... Two Dios?!
Please spar with me!
A race? Wait, what are you talking about? We're merely...
You! You're one of the allies that Speedwagon found, right?
Mr Zeppeli! I'm going to go all-out!
I'll counterattack with a Hamon barrage!
Let's put an end to this right here!
We have no choice but to fight, Johnny! Keep your heart strong!
Hmph.
Whew...
Why did this happen? What's the meaning of this?!
I need to learn more about this Hamon energy!
I won't cry over burying you!
Your fate is sealed!
You will pay for creating that wretched Stone Mask, Kars!
He's stronger than the zombies...and the vampires too! Just what is he?!
Allow me to properly introduce myself. I'm Jonathan Joestar... What's your name?
That incredible "power" of his... Just what is it?
I've almost got it... I'm so close to understanding Hamon!
Mr Zeppeli... You and I are birds of a feather. We share similar pasts!
Thanks for always being there for me, Speedwagon.
I fight to protect my father, and to protect the Joestar family! Your soul doesn't burn with the same fire as mine!
Erina? Did you just say Grandma Erina? And that face of yours... No, it couldn't be!!
What a novel idea! Please show me more about the way you use Hamon!
There's such a gentle wind blowing...
I am proud to have fought with a warrior like you!
He's even more powerful than Dio! Just what is he?!
He knows about Hamon... Did he say 2,000 years ago?
Just who is this guy?
He has some other power as well, separate from his Hamon...
Dio... This will be the end for good...
I guess that we were one and the same.
Did you just fix what you punched? What kind of technique was that?!
What a polite young man. I'm not sure about that hair of yours, though...
You remind me so much of him... Could it be?
The pulse of your life... It's so unique!
Now, it's time to turn yourself in.
I can't believe I just hit a woman. I've lost my right to be a gentleman!
What in Heaven's name in he doing?!
Joseph, why are you dressed like that? Is there a masquerade happening somewhere?
I thought you were a violent one at first, but you're strangely calm. Just who are you?
Does that mean you're my descendant?
So, you're my descendant! My blood flows within you!
Judging from your eyes, you're telling the truth.
This doesn't mean I've forgiven you, Dio!
Honestly, Dio, I don't feel any sense of friendship toward you!
This is all thanks to you, Dio!
There's no mistaking it. My blood flows within you!
I couldn't see yours at all! Just what are Stands?
Now to finish this! Hamon of the sun!
Roger that, Mr Zeppeli!
I'm not finished yet! I can still fight!
I have an ally who I can always trust to cover for me! That's why I won!
Did you need some help?
Yes! Everyone needs courage! We need to stay strong!
We won this thanks to you, Joseph!
Feel the beat of my Hamon!
I'm impressed that you've managed to master Hamon this well!
I'm honored to be fighting beside a Hamon teacher like you!
Elegant and gorgeous! Movements as smooth as silk! Just what sort of training could make someone that agile?
That's the spirit, Mr Joseph!
What a cunning strategy! I could never replicate that...
Dio... Just as you once said, we were one and the same. I even feel like we have a bizarre sort of friendship...
That is indeed the Dio I know! But...something's different...
A Stand, huh? I'd like to try one out myself...
I think your healing power is more amazing than anything I can do, Josuke!
Dio... Whenever I look at you, I'm reminded of him for some reason.
Your father?! You mean...you're Dio's son?!
The way she carries herself...her calm judgment calls... This girl knows how to fight!
Nice follow-up there!
We won this thanks to you, Joseph!
How are you able to move so well in that foppish costume?!
I'm so happy to be standing here right now, Jotaro...
No, wait! That power you just used...
Have you inherited my—er, your father's will?
I couldn't see anything! What was that power he just used?
I'm sorry for dragging you into such a dangerous battle. No wait, I should be thanking you, Speedwagon!
Dio! I'll put an end to your evil ambitions!
Humans can do anything as long as they have faith! We can evolve too! You'll see!
Now to hit you with a double dose of Hamon!
It's so cold, it feels like I've been burned! My skin's been ripped off, as if it got stuck to frozen metal!
Fate has led us down such a long and bizarre road, Dio...
I can feel great potential in both of their Hamons!
Why are they so ferocious?! They seem prepared to defeat us at any cost!
What kind of ability is that? You seem to be overflowing with energy! I sense an overwhelming power from you!
Mr Zeppeli, I trust you. That's why I've given this battle my all...
I know you all used to be humans... Forgive me for hurting you.
I can sense limitless evil within those two!
Something's not right here... That Valentine man... He isn't attacking to kill!
Please back me up!
Here goes!
Ready?
Please assist me!
Yeah!
Leave it to me!
Yes sir!
I'll go first!
Follow me!
Wow! Excellent work!
A fine attack!
I need to fight hard enough for both of us now!
Mr Zeppeli!
Nooooo! You will pay for this!
Dio...!
Speed...wagon!
I should have been there to protect you!
Yeah!
That's the strangest head I've ever seen! What secrets doth it hold, I wonder?
Kaaaaaaaa...
Pow!
What exactly is "courage"?
Courage comes from conquering your fear!
Rorrrgh!
Hamon of the Sun!
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!!
I can feel it! The Hamon is now inside!
Right... I'll handle this.
Here they come!
Phew!
Ngh...
Fighting myself? Well, stranger things have happened...
That hat doesn't suit you.
I'll show you the energy that comes from proper breathing!
It's now your fate to fight against the Stone Mask!
Hmmm. It'll hurt at first, but you don't mind, do you?
Speedwagon. You should understand full well that you're shouldering a lighter load than the rest of us.
Allow me to briefly speak to the Stone Mask that awakened your brain... "I've finally found you!"
Bastard! How many lives have you sucked away to heal those wounds?!
Th-this young man... His power is unspeakable!
This young man... Could he be?
He knows about the weaknesses of Hamon! Just who is he?
Now what do we have here? He feels even stronger than a vampire...
This guy is just unpredictable...
Are you trying to smother me? Step back!
I studied and mastered Sendo so I could one day destroy the Stone Mask!
Hmph! As long as you don't get ripped in two first!
I know that face! You're Dio!
You seem even more evil than before... Is this the Stone Mask at work again?!
Ready to go, JoJo?
Let me assist you, JoJo!
Mm! Attaboy, JoJo!
Don't overdo it now, Speedwagon!
Hmm. Are you sure about this?
Watch my back, Speedwagon!
Lend me your strength, Caesar!
Let's give them what for, Caesar!
Bastard! How many lives have you sucked away to heal those wounds?!
That man must be obliterated at all costs!
JoJo!
I'm...frozen! What is this?!
Fate must have brought all us Hamon warriors together!
Here they come, JoJo! Steady your breath!
It's a master's duty to see that his disciples' errors are set straight! Bring it on!
Prepare yourself, scoundrels!
We're going to defeat you!
Hmph.
Haaaah!
Looks like my Hamon is the superior one!
This is bone-breaking work...
JoJo! Keep the rhythm of your breathing just as I taught it!
I taught you everything I know, JoJo... You are my only hope now!
My finger slipped. Whoops! Sorry about that Speedwagon!
I underestimated you. I thought you'd simply run when things got hairy... I apologize!
We've got an evil tyrant on our hands! Better finish him off now while we still can!
The evil—I can feel it! It's overwhelming!
I feel like I just trained my own son and a best friend at the same time.
I see hope in you...
Don't tell me... That's one of the Pillar Men?! The mysterious clan who eradicated the Hamon Warriors 2,000 years ago?!
He knows about Hamon... But how?
Fear quakes your very breath! But overcome it, and you will be able to breathe properly!
Don't you know how important it is to keep wine at the right temperature?!
I'm going to crush every last one of the Stone Masks you created!
My Hamon Cutters are far sharper than your blades!
It's finally the end of the line...for you and the Stone Mask!
He's far beyond the reaches of Hamon now! I only won because luck was on my side...
Yes! Well done, JoJo! Those are the basics! There are still many different ways to utilize Hamon!
Your Hamon energy charging technique still needs a lot of work!
Careful now, your breathing is getting unsteady! Do you need a rest?
It appears I underestimated you. Allow me to apologize, Speedwagon!
Hoh! Not bad, Speedwagon!
Men like you may be the ones who can truly succeed in the world...
That talent, that power... Mm! Simply wonderful!
This is the proud soul of the Zeppeli family!
I underestimated you. I thought you'd simply run when things got hairy... I apologize!
Let's see you make some noise. Pow!
Take that, Dio!
I can't let JoJo get hurt, no matter the cost! He has yet to reach his full potential!
JoJo, fighting these two reminded me of the old you...
You're just attacking whoever you see first... Don't you care who you fight?
There's nothing so pitiable as an unworthy disciple... At least I can put you to rest with my own hand!
Feast on my Hamooon!
Yes! Attaboy, Caesar!
Time for a focused attack!
Let's go!
So be it!
Mmm!
Step aside!
Follow my lead!
A fine attack!
Excellent!
Just leave the rest to me...
Nnnggh! JoJo!
Jo...Jo...
Inherit my will!
Ultimate Deep Pass Overdrive!
Just leave the rest to me...
Let's go!
You know, I've seen a lot in my life, but that 'do of yours takes the cake!
Bloody hell!
You're wide open!
Ha ha!! That sound—the blade's hit bone!
You took that head-on!!
Time to dice you up!
Get ready!
I fight hard when it really counts, y'know!
How'd that feel?!
Here goes...
Your opponent's right here!
Tsk!
Tch...
Is that ME?!
What the?! Someone's dressed up as me!
Let's go, Mr Joestar! I'll take you on as many times as you want!
Huh? Don't try to bluff!
Can I learn that Hamon thing too? I wanna try it out! Teach it to me! C'mon, I'm begging you!
That may be so, but I still wanna do what I can to help out!!
Just knowing that you're still alive and well casts a black shadow over my heart!
I knew you reeked! You smell worse than vomit! I bet you've been evil since the day you were born!
Mr Joestar... Is that you?
Hey! Outta the way, scamp!
The name's Speedwagon. What's yours?
What is this crap? Bubbles? You must be a little soft in the head...
You're a Hamon master, right? Please! Teach me how to use it too!
Hey lady, you've got some nice clothes on you! Allow me to take them off your hands!!
What in the hell happened to your body?!
You say something, Robo-head?
I may not be able to use Hamon... But I can't back down now!
Look how tense his muscles are! This guy's definitely hiding some kind of power from us!
Shut up already! I'm gonna beat you into the mud!
Oh... Oh no! This guy's gonna be trouble!
He reeks! He stinks worse than rotting flesh!!
What's that glow?! His blades are glowing!
You're the one who needs to step down, old man!
That's one big old man. He's about as tall as Mr Joestar!
I've never seen you before in my life!!
Knock it off! Get away from me!!
This pitch black aura... But it can't be!!
Is that you, Dio?! No, he feels even more powerful than the Dio I know!
I got worried about you, so I came to help!
Let's wipe the floor with 'em!
I'll fight with you, Mr Joestar!
I didn't come all this way just to hold you back, y'know!
Let's see what you're really made of!
Leave it to me, sir!
How rude! Just you watch!
You took the words right out of my mouth!
I'll let you handle the Hamon work!
You're a Hamon user too?! I'll be counting on you to back me up, then!
That's my line, dammit!
You're a Hamon master, right? Teach me how to use it!
Hey, lady! I'm still pretty young, y'know!
Blimey! His entire body is a machine!
What?! You're immortal?!
Tell me your plan, commander—I'll follow it to a T!
I'd better not hearing ya gasping for air halfway through the battle, ya old geezer!!
C'mon, pops, we've got enemies to beat! Now's not the time for that!
Get away from me! I'd rather fight on my own!
Do I really have no choice but to team up with you?
He reeks! He stinks worse than vomit!! Worse than vomit itself, I say!!
Mr Joestar, what's come over you? You can't be serious!!
This battle will end in a split second, and their intertwining fate will finally be laid to rest!!
You're not going anywhere! As a human, it's my duty to stop you!
Just knowing that he's still alive and well casts a black shadow over my heart, and makes me sweat like mad!
Haaaa!
Hmph.
What in bloody hell is going on here?!
All right now, off with the disguise, you snake!
I know I'm not the right man for the job, but I want to help you out somehow, even just a little...
I don't believe it! He wasn't bluffing! He's prepared not just to lose his fingers, but both legs as well! He has the mental fortitude to withstand any manner of fear or pain!
Yeah! Bring it on, don't hold back! Let's see you go all-out!
Well?! Now do you see?! I didn't come all this way just to hold you and Mr Joestar back!
You're gonna pay! As a human, it's my duty to stop you!
Mr Joestar shouldn't have to dirty his hands here. I'm perfectly capable of cleaning up a puke stain like you!
That isn't Mr Joestar, but he looks just like him!
Well I'll be! I see you've been through your share of fights!
Zeppeli? That guy's related to Mr Zeppeli?
What the hell did you do to your clothes? What is this, soap? It's all sticky, dammit!
Hey, what was that just now?! Why can't I do that too?
That flashy red jewel of yours is nothing but a huge "kick me" sign!
I don't believe this! How did he turn his entire body into a machine?!
Why are you looking for the Stone Mask? Tell me everything!
I actually won...against a monster like him? Ha ha ha ha!
What's all this wind?! It's even stronger than the tornado that blew away all those huge trees in the Caribbean!
I fight hard when it really counts, y'know! Time for you to eat your words, punk! Serves ya right!
I've never seen a monster like this before! He can boil his own blood and shoot his blood vessels out like needles!
He's been evil since the day he was born! Rotten to the core!
Each of the sharp, claw-like edges on those blades are moving at high speeds and reflecting light in minute detail! That's why it looks like they're glowing!
This guy's got some crazy moves! They were kind of like Hamon, but kind of different... What were they?!
He knew who I was... Have I met this old guy somewhere before?
You're grossing me out! Go torment someone else!!
Not even a blind man would think you're a woman!!
I won?! I...beat Dio?!
He's developed an ability even more powerful than the Vaporizing Freeze! I need to tell Mr Joestar about this!
That's my Mr Joestar... I don't know what I was worried for!
I'll bet Erina can't wait for you to come home!
Yeaaah! We won!!
How was that?!
See? I can fight too, Mr Zeppeli!
I can dream big, at least!
I'm no old man! Didn't your mother teach you any manners?!
I'm no thug! I'm Speedwagon!!
I appreciate the offer, but every man's got his own role to play!
A man named Zeppeli taught me everything I know!!
What do you mean better than you thought? What's that supposed to mean?!
Please, Lisa Lisa! I have a friend I want to help out! People I want to save!
What's that cold glare for...?
I've been all over the world, but I've never seen ANYTHING like you!
How did you even do that to yourself?!
You're absolutely out of your mind, but...you're really strong!
I guess you really can fight, gramps!
Don't tell me...he's gone senile?
I hate to admit it, but...you're strong! Dammit! Just what the hell is up with you?!
He never accepts defeat, regardless of the situation...
He's been "unique" since the day he was born!
I came because I was worried about what sort of trouble that pure heart of yours might get you into. I don't care what you say, I'm sticking with you 'til the end!
We finally did it! It may sound like an exaggeration, but we saved the world!
I didn't come all this way just to hold you and Mr Joestar back!
Mr Zeppeli! Give him a taste of your Hamon!
Lend me a hand!
Ready to go?
Got it!
Here goes!
How was that?!
I'll create an opening!
Now that was bloody insane!
That's my buddy!
I'll avenge you!!
No! How could this happen?! Mr Joestar!
Mr Zeppeliiii!!
See, I told you to stay back, damn you!
They actually beat you?!
See what that costume got you?!
Got it!
What disgusting hair...
Wooooryyyyyaaahhh!!
You thought you stood a chance? Idiot!
Weak, WEAK!
Behold the oblivion of death!
Ah, there you are.
Ah, there you are.
Garbage...
Hmph!
The world needs only one emperor!
How dare you take my name!
JoJooo!
Behold the magnificent power that the Stone Mask has granted me!
You think you can make Dio your prey?! I'd like to see you try!
So you're one of the Pillar Men... And I'm Dio, the man who's going to kill you.
Come on, you magician! Your life will heal my wound quite nicely!
Do you remember how many breads you have eaten in your life?
Cockroach...
You... You're that maggot Speedwagon, from the Joestar residence...
I'll turn you into an icicle with my Vaporizing Freeze!!
So you're one of those Pillar Men...
You're no match for Dio's Vaporizing Freeze!
A Pillar Man? Can't wait to destroy you.
A "Stand," you say? Interesting. Try it on me!
Where did you get such an ego? I'll slice you up and feed you to my zombies!
Jonathan's grandson? Hmph...
Let's take out the small fries first.
Let's win this, JoJo!
I can't believe I have to team up with HIM!
I'm going to show you who stands on top.
I don't care who stands in my way! They're all going to die!
Both you and your friend there will become a part of my life-force!
I'm going to wring the life out of you!
Do you remember how many breads you have eaten in your life?
I am at the peak of all creation... A new life form, sent to forge a new future!
If I freeze all your blood vessels, you won't be able to send any energy into them!
UREEYYYYY!
Prepare yourselves to become part of my life-force!
Feed on his flesh! Suck up the marrow of his bones!
You're the monster, you miserable excuse for a human...
Hmph! Here I come, JoJooo!
You all came here to die like dogs!
You IDIOT!
Utter garbage!!
With immortality and eternal life, I now have the power to conquer the world!
You'll be the one facing the oblivion of death!
Come, JoJo! Accept my vampire extract, and become my newest slave!
Goodbye, JoJooo!
UUURRRRYYY! Now it's your turn to become the prey!
The world I aim to create has no place for Pillar Men!
I have no reason to remain in this place!
Hamon? Breathing? If you insist on flapping your lips, you may as well whistle a fanfare for me!
Piss-ant!
How dare you make me waste time on trash like you...
What a hideous ice sculpture... But I'll put it on special display, as proof of Dio's almighty power!!
When I first found out about you all, I was a bit taken aback. But now, I'm not worried in the least!
I'll just freeze all your blood vessels, you fool!
You really thought you could defeat me, Dio? You're the one who doesn't know your place!
Stands... When I first found out about them, I was a bit taken aback. But now, I'm not worried in the least!
An interesting ability. But remember, I, Dio surpassed every superhuman creature in our world in only a single night!
That was nothing compared to Jonathan Joestar's Hamon. Weak, WEAK!
When I heard you were a descendant of the Joestars, I was surprised, but... What a disappointment!
Hmph! My thoughts exactly, JoJo!
Hmph! Friendship?! Don't even mention garbage like that—and don't you DARE smile at me!
Nice fight, JoJo!
Weak, WEAK!
It was I, Dio!
You managed to impress me with how prepared you were, even if it only lasted for a second.
Can a monkey match a human? No! And to me, you're nothing but a MONKEY, JoJooooo!!
All your hopes have collapsed into thin air!
You think I'd ever step down to the same level as a mere human!? What insolence!
I vaporized your arms and froze them so that blood ceased to flow! That's why you can't pass any Hamon energy into them, you imbeciles!!
I vaporized all the water in your arms just by touching them! When water vaporizes, it also loses heat—I froze your arms in a single instant!!
Hmph! And you know, I was almost starting to respect you a little...
Goodbye, JoJooo!
Weak! So weaaak! My zombies will eat off your pale little faces!
May you waste away in this frontier world, JoJooooo!
The corpse belongs with I, Dio!
Now!
Hurry it up!
Very good.
Don't hold me back!
Me first!
After me!
Not bad, I guess.
Perhaps I underestimated them.
After me!
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDAAA!
It's over now...
WREYYYYYY
Dio can finish this on his own!
I always said you were too naive!
Very good.
Jonathan's grandson? Hmph...
That was nothing compared to Jonathan Joestar's Hamon. Weak, WEAK!
When I heard you were a descendant of the Joestars, I was surprised, but... What a disappointment!
That hair makes your head look stupid huge, bro!
Watch this trick!
Clacker Volley!
Hamon Overdrive Beat!
I'm gonna crush you to pieces!!
Get outta town!
Kohhhh...
Acha!
Hmph.
Tch...
Huh? Who's this freak?
This ain't no joke, you country bumpkin!
Oh no! If there's one word I hate, it's "working," and if there's another, it's "hard!"
Hey... You mad, bro?
But Stroheim got blown to bits in Mexico! How are you here right now?!
They do say that Germany is hiding some crazy medicine and science and preparing for war, but...
Huh? Gramps? The hell did you just call me?!
You took the words right out of my mouth!
Joseph Joestar's gonna take you down!
The hell I do! In your dreams!
Grandma Erina said I'm the spitting image of my late grandfather!
Are you one of those super hardcore dudes?
I know those eyes! And that scar!
What did you just say? Let's hear it once more...slowly!
Don't think I'll go easy! Beauties like you only add fuel to my fire!
Now, how should I pick on you? Heh heh heh!
Yeah, there's one thing you forgot about: I'm here to kick your ass!
Bring it, Wamuu!
Try to take me down!
You followed me here?!
You're the scum of the earth, Kars!
Kars! You're as rotten as a moldy, fly riddled pumpkin!
Who's this old fart?
I get the feeling that I've seen you somewhere before...
Stupid kid! I've got your MUDA right here!
A "Stand"? You're not making any sense!
My name is Joseph Joestar, but you can call me JoJo!
I just moved here from London, so I hope you can show me the ropes!
Excuse me?! Them's fighting words, pal!
What the?! Suzie Q?!
You're no match for me, old man!
Just shut up and fight me already!
Hamon uses the same energy as the light of the sun! And you don't like the sun, do ya?!
Time to get some revenge for my grandpa!
You're just a piece of garbage that needs to hurry up and die already! If you need help finding the way down to hell, allow me to give you a little shove!
Don't say my name like we're friends or something! You think I'd ever buddy up with some crummy vampire?!
Match your breathing with mine!
Time to show 'em what we've learned!
I think it's about time we broke out that awesome combo of ours, Caesar!
You better not break down before this ends, Stroheim!
Hey! Watch where you're pointing those things!
Watch it, Stroheim! You'd better chill out, or you're just gonna get busted up again!
Just don't hold me back, alright?!
You can use Hamon too?
Hermit...whatzit?
What was your name again? Cack-Yo-Ween?
Let's go wild on these nerds, Josuke!
Time to bring the pain, Josuke!
We come from a proud bloodline!
Yeah! Wait 'till you see our Hamon!!
Speedwagon... You can fight?
Just don't get your ass kicked, you goon!
OK, here we go! I'm getting the hang of your strategy now!
Great minds think alike, Lisa Lisa!
Don't throw your back out or anything, mmkay?
I knew I could count on you, Lisa Lisa!
So where'd you park that Silver Chariot I keep hearing about?
What are you on? I've never felt better!
Why do I feel like I'm being talked down to...
HAPPY JOYPY!
This old fart's got some tricks up his sleeve...
The old you... Wait, are you talking about me?!
Now I have to partner up with some mutt?!
This mongrel keeps sniffing me! What's his problem?!
You've got some mouth, kid...
Hmm, maybe I've been underestimating this guy a bit!
A girl? You sure you know how to fight?
I've always had a soft spot for American gals!
You think you can order me around? I march to my own beat, period!
The hell is THAT supposed to mean?
Jotaro, was it? Lend me a hand here!
Huh? You're the old man here!
Caesar
You know, I'm feeling generous today, so I think it's about time I showed you my brand new super duper secret move!
Are you talking to us as a warrior, or just a sullen little brat, Kars?!
He's equipped with a mechanical hand and some weird mecha-corset on his face!
Hey, I hate solemn stuff like this...
Caesar, I changed my mind! Let me defeat the Pillar Men with you!
Lisa Lisa! Stroheim! Let's go!
Goddammit! You guys are gonna pay for this!
Let's go, Caesar!
Caesar? Aren't you getting a bit overexcited?
Tsk!
You're a real jerk, you know that?!
Well that was unexpected. You actually gave me some trouble back there!
What backwoods town did you come from?
Nice, nice! Verrrry nice, Caesar!
You couldn't even beat that pigeon!
Whew... I don't know how to feel about this. He isn't such a bad guy, but MAN, that ego! I guess I'm kinda glad I met him, though.
Broheim! Arrogant as ever, I see!
There anything besides air in that head of yours?
Every single thing you do gets on my nerves!!
Gonna be kinda hard to do this with that big head of yours, but... Knock knock, helloooo?
You need to take a good look in the mirror, man! Your head looks like a giant potato!
Now I know who you are! But how are you standing here right now?!
OHHH NOOO! I don't ever wanna train with a tough guy like you again!
That young guy was Speedwagon!
If you want me to move, you'll have to make me!
Man or woman, I have no mercy!
Just how old are you, really?!
I don't know why myself, but I gotta respect you.
You were a great fighter... But Caesar, my strongest ally, was here for me to the end!
You may think you're above me, but I'm so high you'll never touch me!
"Victory is decided before you even start to fight!"
I'm good at tricking, but not so good at being tricked!
This JoJo can predict anything! Obviously that's not true, but I'm sure it'll piss Kars off, so I'm gonna say it! Heh!
Now... Where have I seen that face before?
Who is this guy? And how does he know all my moves?
Respect your elders, kid!
I got hit by something I couldn't see! How did he do that?!
So they call you JoJo too, huh? Guess we should try to get along, then.
Are all American gals as tough as you?!
Heh! That's what you get for talking smack to me!
Just what did I ever do to you, huh?!
Who you calling gramps?! I'd take a look in the mirror if I were you, bud!
Did I overdo it a little? Sorry, old man... Can you stand up on your own?
Apparently, the natural breathing rhythm I was born with creates some sort of bizarre energy within me!
Thought your weird eye lasers would surprise me, huh? Been there, done that!
Whoa! You're pretty strong for a vampire! That took way more work than I thought it would!
You've got some crazy powers there! Isn't that stuff against vampire rules or something?!
Nice, Caesar! Nice Hamon work!
What? What are you looking at? You mad, bro?
A winning combo!
I uh, guess a body like that must come in handy...uh, somewhere...
Your next line will be...! Actually, never mind. I'm starting to feel silly here...
I'll give you props, Stroheim. You're definitely the most durable man on the planet!
You still gonna call me gramps?! Just what is your problem, huh?
That "Stand" thing isn't Hamon... So then what is it?
All in a day's work! Right, Kakyoin?
You're not half bad, Kakyoin! I hope I get to fight alongside you again!
Okay, now give him a snappy one-liner!
This'll blow you away!
We did it, grandpa!
All together now!
I take back what I said about you, gramps! You're pretty strong!
Not too shabby, you goon!
Ever thought about taking up Hamon?
You don't need to worry about praising me too much, y'know!
(wheeze) How can you keep moving around like that, Lisa Lisa?
She complimented me! Yippee!
A Stand? And a mechanical arm? Hold up! I want answers here!
Hey, you need to explain things if you're gonna go off on some weird tangent like that!
That's some serious swagger you've got there, Avdol!
I'm just trying to drop our opponent's guard! I'm not just screwing around here, Avdolly!
Wait... Do you know me, old man?
You know, I wanted to look forward to growing old...
Not bad for a mutt! What's his name?
Does he like me or something? His eyes look kind of evil, you know...
Who's gonna hold who back? Hmm?
Your next line will be "You also exceeded my expectations!"
That was some first class string slingin'.
Stoic women aren't really my type, but I'm really not sure I could handle one with a violent streak, either!
What was that? You really cherish me that much?!
We won!! HAPPY JOYPY!
Thanks for the help, Jotaro!
I'm still young and beautiful, dammit!
Remember, I'm the first man to cut your forehead. It should be no wonder that I'd get even stronger with a little effort!
You fell right into my trap again!
Broheim! You need to cool it with the ego already!
Your torso is robotic too?!
Shuddup already! I'm only doing this because you begged me to!
It's weird to see you being this honest, Caesar!
Does this mean we completed the final test already?
Our Hamon have gotten stronger!
Our Hamon...can reach them!
Caesar, what's going on? You don't seem yourself at all...
Don't fail me now!
C'mon!
Yeah!
Let the master work!
First dibs!
You're up next!
Very nice!
Nice one!
Is this true compassion?
Caesaaaaaar!
Your spirit will live on in me!
Stupid chrome dome! You just HAD to show off!
Whoa! Speedwagon!
Lisa Lisa!
Okay, let's do this!
So, how many birds you got in there?
Watch this trick!
Clacker Volley!
Hamon Overdrive Beat!
I'm gonna crush you to pieces!!
Get outta town!
I brought you all some delicious tequila!!
Tequila delivery!
Acha!
Hmph.
Tch...
Ugh! What a horrid outfit!
Why don't you go look in a mirror—then we'll talk!
Heh heh heh! Stunned by my beauty, are you?
Are you one of those super hardcore dudes?
I know that scar, and those handsome eyes!
My! How rude!
Wait... Did you see through my disguise?!
Caesar... Hold on, I'm dressed like this for a reason!
Your eyes look so cold... Like you're staring at a pig...
Now, how should I pick on you? Heh heh heh!
Whoa there, Stroheim... Argh, I knew this wouldn't work!
I brought you all some delicious tequila!!
Yeah, there's one thing you forgot about: I'm here to kick your ass!
Wamuu?! Crap, I won't be able to fight properly in this outfit!
J-JoJo? Now who could that be? I'm just an innocent lady!
Stupid Esidisi hasn't even noticed!
You just crossed the line there, pal...
Sh-shoddy?!
(fidget, fidget)
My, what a handsome gentleman!
You'll never be able to take your eyes off me!
Has this old guy managed to see through my disguise?!
Joseph Joestar's gonna take you down!
Wh-what ever could be the matter? Oh ho ho ho...
Whoa, time out! Isn't that a bit of a contradiction?
My! How rude!
(fidget, fidget)
Oh ho ho! Howdy doo!
I-I've come to deliver some...tequila...
I knew I should have changed for this...
I'm not your gramps! I'm a LADY!
Mm ho ho... How does my dress look? Well? How does it look?!
I brought you all some delicious tequila!!
I'm not your gramps! I'm a LADY!
We come from a proud bloodline!
Is he embarrassed for me?
Hey, wait! You can't go out there alone!
Let's do this, Speedwagon!
Remember now, HAPPY JOYPY, Speedwagon baby!
Match your breathing with mine!
Here I come, Caesar! ...Caesar?
C'mon, Caesar, give me a reaction!
Okay, okay, Lisa Lisa...
Just two women here! Right, Lisa Lisa?!
I didn't think that being accepted would make me feel so...conflicted...
It's a disguise, man, a disguise! I'm going to use this to throw the enemy off guard!
Hey! Watch where you're pointing those things!
You don't...swing that way, do you Stroheim?
(fidget, fidget)
Follow me, sweetie!
Off we go, Kakyoin!
I was completely disguised, and you still figured out who I was?
All ready now, Jean Pierre?
Hmm? You must have good taste if you're calling out to a woman like me!
You think that's bad? How do you think I feel!?
Well? Is this perfect, or is this perfect, Avdol?!
You'll never be able to take your eyes off me!
Gramps! Now isn't the time for stupid jokes!
Off we go, you mongrel!
I can tell by this pup's eyes that he's thinking something very insulting right now...
I'm not trying to be funny here!!
Time to bring the pain, Josuke!
Aww, look how bashful you've become! Oh ho!
What? Don't tell me you'd rather be partnered up with someone else?
There's nothing ridiculous about my outfit!
You'll never be able to take your eyes off me!
I'm planning to get the jump on our enemy with this!
Looks like you figured it out on your own! Good!
I'm planning to get the jump on our enemy with this!
Looks like you figured it out on your own! Good!
This disguise is PERFECT! What's your problem with it?!
You call THAT a disguise?
Oh ho! I might get addicted to this...
OHHH NOOO! I don't ever wanna train with a tough guy like you again!
Speedwagon, you old fox! You're gonna have to do more than dress up like your younger self to trick this guy!
What?! But my disguise was perfect! How did you know it was me?
I knew you'd be able to see through my disguise, Caesar!
Don't interrupt people when they're talking, nimrod!
Don't think I'll go easy! Beauties like you only add fuel to my fire! You're not gonna beat me!
There anything besides air in that head of yours, honey?!
Next time maybe I'll go for something more believable, like a soldier...
Dammit, I...I was hoping you'd say that! I knew you'd be able to figure it out!
Oh nooo! The wind's blowing up my skirt!
I managed to win, but...how did Wamuu figure out it was me?
Don't tell me YOU'VE got a problem with me cross-dressing! At least I'm not half-naked!
Kyaaahh! The hot wind's blowing up my skirt!
Oh my! You ripped my skirt into tatters, you animal!
Damn you! What was the giveaway?!
Excuse me? That was the roughest full-body search I've ever experienced!
Whew... I managed to get through that without him noticing.
I can't believe he instantly knew it was me. This old man's really something... I have no doubt about it now!
This guy was pretty tough... Just who is he?
Oh ho! I might get addicted to this...
Aww, look how bashful you've become! Oh ho!
Hmph! Well I never!
Bye bye! Ciao!
Oh ho! Does that mean I'm as beautiful as the morning sun?
You saw through my disguise right away?! Is this that "woman's intuition" thing?
What could my disguise still be missing...?
Heavens! You brute!
Oh, look how bashful you are! How cute!
What could my disguise still be missing...?
That was close! I shouldn't have taken him on in this getup... But I still managed to win!
I won! I avenged my grandfather...in drag!
We did it, grandpa!
Bet you've got a different opinion of me now!
See? You wouldn't have been able to do that on your own!
Whew! Looks like my plan to disconcert the enemy was a total smash!
You just can't bear to fight without me now, can you? Mm-hm! <icon heart>
Nice, Caesar! Nice Hamon work!
Knock it off, Caesar! Stop laughing!
I bet we'd make the perfect couple!
Umm... Lisa Lisa?
You don't need to compliment me THAT much, Lisa Lisa!
You are tearing me APART, Lisa Lisa!
If I can't even surprise my allies, then I'll never be able to surprise my enemies, Stroheim!
Your next line will be...! Actually, never mind. I'm starting to feel silly here...
In your dreams!!
I'm dead serious, honey.
See? I can fight perfectly well in this!
Well, Kakyoin? How about making your own "disguise"?
You think I should add a little more makeup?
OH! MY! GOD!! I never even though of that!
Wah hah hah! I make a pretty good woman, don't I?!
What? You were talking about me? That hurts, Avdol...
This isn't a costume! It's a DISGUISE, Avdol!!
I can drive men to do some pretty crazy things, wouldn't you agree?
It's rude to stare at people and laugh!!
Not bad for a dog!
See? This is why we humans rule over you mutts!
This disguise is flawless! What's your problem with it?!
Yeah! Got a problem with that?
Don't you think you're being a bit too cold to such a beauty?
Won't know until I try, now will I?!
I'm dead serious, honey.
Ho ho ho ho...
You only won thanks to me! What's with the 'tude?
I think I stumbled across a killer strategy here!
You only won thanks to me! What's with the 'tude?
I think I stumbled across a killer strategy here!
Be a dear, would you?
C'mon!
Okie dokie!
Let the master work!
Ladies first!
You're up next!
Very nice!
Nice one!
I'll fight hard enough for both of us!
Caesaaaaaar!
You've gotta be kidding me, Stroheim!!
Whoa... You can't be serious!
No way! Lisa Lisa!
Okie dokie!
Tsk!
You're a real jerk, you know that?!
Hamon uses the same energy as the light of the sun! And you don't like the sun, do ya?!
Time to get some revenge for my grandpa!
Apparently, the natural breathing rhythm I was born with creates some sort of bizarre energy within me!
Thought your weird eye lasers would surprise me, huh? Been there, done that!
What's some redneck like you doing with that huge hair?!
Bubble Cutter...
...variation!
Burn black!
Time to test out the fruits of my training!
I've no choice but to fight!
Ooh, I don't like the sound of that.
Tch! I don't want to team up with YOU!
I have to overcome this Hamon trial!
I gotta do this! I need this training to survive!
I'll help you out with your Hamon training. We both need to grow stronger...
You're a moron who doesn't know the first thing about Hamon!
So that's how you crawled back up from the brink of death...
I hear the Germans are dying to research the scientific possibilities of my Hamon...
You'll pay for soiling the Zeppeli name!
I...think I know this man...
I'm Zeppeli. Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli!
Imagine how it's gonna feel when you lose to these bubbles!
Spar with me!
Lisa Lisa! Do we have to start another trial right now?
What the?! Wait, I thought I just saw something... It must have been a hallucination...
Right now, my mind is back in the slums! Back in the place where my father fell into your trap and died!
Your defeat will be cold and cruel!
Esidisi! So you're here!
Time to test out the fruits of my training!
It's the moment the Zeppeli clan has waited for! Kars! I'm gonna beat you down!
I'm going to avenge my father! Bring it on, Kars!
What do you want, old man? Have I met you before?
I wouldn't try it if I were you, old man. Just go back to the sticks, where you belong.
JoJo... Just when I thought you couldn't possibly get any stupider...you managed to outdo yourself!
JoJo... We need to talk...
No, YOU match YOUR breathing with MINE!
You're coming with me, you moron!
Fine, if you insist. Let's go, JoJo.
Please allow me the honor!
Yes! They're no match for our spirit!!
This guy...knows about Hamon?
Hmph! I never thought I'd have to team up with some common thug!
Of course! We need to attack without hesitation!
Watch and see how much I've grown, Lisa Lisa!
Of course!
Joseph? Is that you, Joseph?
Get back, old man, or you might break more than you can spare.
No, YOU match YOUR breathing with MINE!
No...never mind. Let's just get started here, JoJo...
Knowing you, it's no wonder that you're interested in that kind of stuff...
JoJo, mind your own damn business! I'm going to settle this on my own!
What?!
JoJo, watch your tongue! The least you could do is thank them for being nice enough to train us!
I don't need your help! This is the Zeppeli clan's battle!
Lisa Lisa...I'm going to fight back now!
Don't talk more than necessary. Remember your breathing.
Yeah! We can beat them now!
Kars! On my honor as a Zeppeli, I will defeat you!
I'll stake the pride of the Zeppeli family on this!
You're too weak! You're useless!
Hmph! Stupid hick!
I need to be stronger... Stronger than I am now...
We need to survive this... You and me both, JoJo!
What the hell was that? I knew this guy was a total idiot!
Your Hamon couldn't even beat that girl!
If he had access to that kind of technology, perhaps Mark could have survived...
I'll help you out, but don't come crying to me if you can't figure out how Hamon works!
Weird. What's this sense of pride swelling up in my chest?
Don't tell me you're my...?
Is this guy related to Speedwagon? He does resemble him...
Have fun flopping around like a fish out of water!
Thanks for the training!
Please forgive me, Lisa Lisa!
These men have already met with Hamon... over 2000 years ago!
Your Wind Protector is like a giant fan, sucking my bubbles right into your body!
I can feel the strength... Lisa Lisa's training has paid off!
I did it! My Hamon worked!
Father... I've avenged you...
My Bubble Cutter is way sharper than your blades!
That Hamon... No, it couldn't be...
Don't tell me this old guy knows how to use Hamon?!
Of course I did, you moron! Go take a look in the mirror!
What on earth?! You must have gone completely mad!
Hmph! It looks like you've finally managed to gain some control over your Hamon, too!
He's as annoying as ever, but he's clearly gotten stronger... I can't let him get ahead of me!!
I've simply become able to predict what's going on in that idiotic head of yours, that's all.
The Zeppeli blood flows through me as well!
This is the proud soul of the Zeppeli family!
Where did you learn about Hamon?
You did better than I thought you would. Guess I underestimated you a bit.
It's all thanks to your training, Lisa Lisa!!
Someday, I'll surpass you as well!
All in a day's work.
Why did you become an old man all of a sudden?!
This old man's using Hamon! Who in the world could he be?
Hmph! It looks like you've finally managed to gain some control over your Hamon, too!
JoJo, that outfit! Ha ha ha ha!
No, I just can't handle this! Stay away from me, JoJo!
I'll help you out with your Hamon training. We both need to grow stronger...
Very clever, JoJo.
I thought you hated solemn stuff? You were fighting like a madman out there, JoJo!
It's only thanks to you that I was able to avenge my bloodline... You have my gratitude, JoJo.
Forgive me, Lisa Lisa!
I can really sense the fruits of all our hard work...
I can feel how I've improved since we last fought...
Kaaaaars! I'm going to wipe you clean off this earth!
I just hit you with my ultimate Hamon!
Give me a hand!
Ready for this?
Now's our chance!
Follow my lead!
I've got this!
Yeah!
Yes, master!
Yes, master!
I'll start this one off!
Take this!
Perfect!
Nice attack.
I won't let your soul die!
How dare you?! Nooo!
JoJooooo!!
How dare you?! Nooo!
You idiot! See what that costume got you?!
I've got this!
What dreadful hair!
Think you can touch me?
How do you like my Sathiphorosia Scarab-thread scarf?
It transmits 100％ of the Hamon that flows through it!
Haaaaa!
That certainly cost you.
I need to carry out my own duty.
(inhales)
I'm not sure I like this...
(sigh) Why did it have to come to this?
Now this is a surprise...
(sigh) What a bother...
This is out of your league.
You're... Speedwagon?!
I'm not teaching you Hamon for your own sake...I do it so you can defeat them!
I haven't lived this long for nothing! I don't need sympathy from some teenager!
You can grow stronger still.
Pass my trial or get out of my sight!
It's my duty to protect the Red Stone. I won't hand it over to anyone!
He transformed his entire body into a machine?!
Now we'll finally find out who gets stand on top in the end: The Pillar Clan of Darkness, or us humans!
It'll take a lot more wind than that to ruffle my scarf.
Is it hot in here or is it just me?
Already sniffed out the Red Stone of Aja, have you?!
Kars' aura... It feels like it's coming from both above and below!
I can sense no bloodlust in Kars' stance... How is he able to suppress it all?!
You've certainly gotten up there in years.
You know me? Just who are you?
Just try and lay a hand on me. I'll make you pay for it with your life!
I don't really feel like fighting, but if you insist...
JoJo... What are you doing?
I haven't lived this long for nothing! I don't need sympathy from some teenager!
Now then, show me your true strength!
Being able to fight alongside you like this is a dream come true.
Don't worry. It's not your fault that I chose the path of Hamon!
Enough talk. Just focus on the enemy in front of you!
Speedwagon in his younger years...
JoJo, don't let your guard down!
I haven't lived this long for nothing! I don't need sympathy from some teenager!
This should be a cinch for you now, JoJo!
Now, how should we approach this?
Show me what you've learned!
We can win this, Caesar! No, we must!
Joseph, is this supposed to be some kind of joke?
Joseph... Have you aged a little?
JoJo, I want a word with you after this.
JoJo... You never cease to amaze me...
Well, I suppose that's a perfectly acceptable fighting style for you.
Death to the Hamon amateurs!
Get away.
My fate has never been anything but bizarre...
Guess you and I are only the same on the outside!
Your scarf lacks elegance!
You've got a rather light burden on your shoulders.
Why do you look like that? Don't tell me you used the Stone Mask?!
I've prepared a thorough training regimen for you... It's so exciting you might just drop dead!
I've always wanted to test that amazing talent of yours...
You mustn't lose control of your Hamon Breathing! Calm yourself and focus!
Your Hamon charging technique still needs a lot of work!
Why is Germany after the red stone?!
Whew... That's one hell of a body.
Return to the wind...
At the very least, you lost with dignity.
You're not even hot enough to burn this scarf!
Esidisi of the Flames... You certainly were tenacious!
It appears that your kind is equal in neither status nor strength!
Seems your bark was worse than your bite.
How old are you now? 67! You're an old geezer!
This Hamon... It couldn't be... JoJo?!
What am I to make of all this? My opponents get stranger by the day!
Done already? I was hoping you'd help me kill some more time...
It's time for the next phase of your training. Hurry up and change.
Tomorrow, you'll begin a new phase of both Hamon and make-up training!
Jonathan Joestar is even stronger than I thought he'd be!
Hearing that makes me feel like I've finally repaid my debt to you. I'm so glad...
I expected no less from the great Jonathan Joestar!
You don't need to worry. You can still support your allies, just the way you are.
Yes... I can sense youth in you, in more ways than one...
If you decide to live as a normal person after all this, you'll either become a crime lord or a very respected man.
JoJo, you still need more training.
You were in very good form today, JoJo!
Excellent breathing, Caesar!
You can still get stronger than this, Caesar!
Well done, Caesar!
You weren't playing around, were you?
I can tell you've got a lot of fighting experience. You've been through a lot in your life...
I've always wanted to test that awful costume of yours... And after seeing how terrible it truly is, I have no choice but to commend you...
(sigh) I'm sure you'll become a very respected person in the future...
Why don't you just dress like that all the time?
With Hamon skills that poor, you deserve to die!
Here I come!
Do as I do!
Yes!
I'll take it from here!
Haaaaaaa!
Take this!
Completely blown away...
That was a good one.
Your efforts were not in vain!!
I don't believe this!
JoJo?! But how?!
Ohhh, Caesar...
See what happens when all you do is screw around?!
Yes!
I'm going to turn your head into a one square centimeter block of meat, just like one would pluck a chicken!
I'm going to turn your head into a one square centimeter block of meat, just like one would pluck a chicken!
Ultraviolet Radiation!
Right!
Put an end to you? I'd be delighted!
WA ha ha ha!
Say goodbye!
Here I coooome!
Come to papa!
I, Stroheim am here with my elite military team to stop you once and for all!!
Pfft! You'd better not get in my way!
Hmph! What a despicable clown!
ANOTHER ME?!
Have they started mass producing me?! I didn't hear anything about this...
Look how fit and healthy you look... Yes, you certainly have matured, Joestar!
I have surpassed the entire human race!!
German medicine and science are the best in the world!
Caesar! It's about time I researched that Hamon of yours!
Eat your hearts out, Brits! Standing before you is the prime example of Germany's superior medicine and science!!
Seems like you know a dangerous secret about that Stone Mask!
I want to hear all you know about the Red Stone and the Pillar Men. Let's work together here...
A Hamon Master?! Yes, what a fitting opponent!
I already know exactly what size cubes I need to slice you into in order to make it impossible for you to survive!!
So you're Wamuu... That was quick. You found out that my army gained possession of the Red Stone and came to steal it, hmm?
Now, time to avenge the experimental troops from Rome!
Esidisi?! But I thought JoJo defeated you!
Who do you think you're glaring at, Kars?! Your very last opponent is right here: me!
Your opponent is Stroheim!
Who are you? Why do you know my name?
My right leg is still a bit creaky, but aside from that, my body's been restored to perfect condition!
JoJo... What have you done...
Stop right there! Something's not right about you!!
Feast your eyes on my army's scientific genius!!
Time to unleash some heavy fire!
JoJo, I can't let you go out there alone. Leave this to me!
Watch closely, Brit, and you may learn a thing or two!
Lend me your strength! I need to complete my research on immortality!
Destroy them—while you're dodging my gunfire!!
JoJooo! What happened to you?!
Time to unleash some heavy fire!
Now that I've gotten a closer look, it doesn't look too bad on you, JoJo...
Who do you think you're glaring at, Kars?! Your very last opponent is right here: me!
I based my new physical strength on Santviento's power!!
You shall praise my perfectioooon!
One wrong move and I'll shoot! No wrong moves and I'll shoot anywaaaaay!
Tch! This was definitely a solo job!
Ugh. I need some fresh air...
German technology knows no bounds! Of course they'd waste no time in mass producing me!
I think you need a better loadout!
JoJo... I crawled back up from hell!
German Science is the best in the world!
My body! It's the pride of the German people, and the prime example of our superior German science!
Now our technology will reach new heights!!
My body! It's the pride of the German people!!
Everything! I want to know everything! Just what have you been through?!
And now, to add the Red Stone to my military's research materials!
You may be able to use Hamon, but you're still human! And I've surpassed the human race, which means you're no match for me!
My bullets will cut you down one by one!
Yessss! Looks like my weapons DO work on Pillar Men after all!
Even after all that talk, my bullets still turned you into swiss cheese, you fool!
Esidisi's still alive?! But that's not what the reports said!
I'm going to turn your body into a one square centimeter block of meat, just like one would pluck a chicken!
Kaaaars! I can't believe I get to put an end to you! What a delight!
JoJoooo! Whoa, JoJo turned into an old man!!
German medicine and pharmaceuticals are the best in the world! They can do anything!
You should look at yourself from a more objective viewpoint...
You thought you could trick me with that disguise? Fool!
Of course! I'm the prime example of superior German science, remember!!
Hu ha ha ha ha!! German science is the best in the world!
Did you see that, JoJo?! This is how a true German soldier fights!
Hu ha ha ha!! There's nothing German science can't do!!
Anything's possible with the power of the Stone Mask... Haven't you heard anything about it, Brit?!
How were you able to do all that without any Hamon?! What spirit! I think I like you!
Forget the enemy, you've already got me stunned!!
Hu ha ha ha ha!! German science is the best in the world!
Now, JoJo, I can use my superior technology to make you into a real woman...
German Science is the best in the world!
Every last piece of data we harvested from Santviento has been assimilated into the weapons that adorn my body!!
Even my name is wonderful! "RUDOL VON STROHEIMMM!"
And thus, Jotaro Kujo's corpse part has been claimed by my army!
Right!
Need backup!
Follow me!
So be it!
Coming right up!
Your opponent's right here!
I'll take the front line!
Well done! You've earned my respect!
What power!
Just leave the rest to me!!
Farewell...
I'll never forget you...
JoJooo! I knew you couldn't cut it in that getup...
So be it!
That hair is laughable.
Hmph!
Prepare yourself for my final Wind Mode...
Gathering Gale!
You die here!
Farewell.
So you've come.
I've been waiting for this.
Ngh...
You?!
Nnngh? What's this?
Well well. This should be a promising fight!
Come at me, young Hamon warrior!
Hoh... I see you're a very experienced Hamon warrior...
I know that your throat and lungs are everything to you! Hamon users can't do anything if they can't breathe...
The Hamon users haven't died out yet?!
Just knock it off and begone.
Wamuu can control the wind with his Wind Mode!
You can freeze someone merely by touching them? Interesting... Wamuu shall be your next opponent!
A mere vampire dares to challenge the great Wamuu? I hope you're prepared for this...
Stop this! Human lives are short enough to begin with. There's no need to hurry to your death!
I, Wamuu, accept you as a true warrior... Therefore, I shall use all of my power to defeat you!
You're Caesar, the bubble man, aren't you?
Very well! You are deemed worthy to be killed by the great Wamuu!
Don't think I'll go easy on a woman. I'll beat you as I would any Hamon user!
I don't like fighting women, but so be it!
You modified your body that much all in order to fight? I like you, human!
I will acquire the Red Stone that Lord Esidisi left for me at any cost!
Lord Esidisi... When you're ready.
Lord Esidisi! Prepare for battle!
Lord Kars... When you're ready.
Lord Kars! Prepare for battle!
You've gotten much older since I last saw you...
JoJo! Wamuu requests a battle with you!
Stop this! Human lives are short enough to begin with. There's no need to hurry to your death!
What unusual attire you've chosen, JoJo...
Lord Esidisi, please entrust this job to Wamuu!
Please leave this to me, Lord Esidisi!
I wish to fight with them, Lord Esidisi!
Please allow me to fight alongside you, Lord Kars!
Yes, Lord Kars!
Lord Kars, please allow me to fight them!
The Hamon users haven't died out yet?!
This is getting interesting.
Please step down, Lord Kars. I can take care of them!
I, Wamuu, will now consider you to be worthy prey!
You are no warrior.
Mongrel!
That wind won't be enough to keep up with mine.
Your wind has died...
I will keep you in a corner of my memory for eternity, Jonathan Joestar.
You met my expectations...which means that you earned the right to die by Wamuu's hand!
Get stronger. Then you may come at Wamuu again...
I thought you Hamon warriors were many, but I see you're all out of allies...
Those eyes have seen hell. No wonder you were able to entertain me...
Of course you lost, human!
Well? When are you going to freeze me?
Insolence to one's master is rewarded with punishment... Prepare yourself!
Fearless eyes! Impertinent words! Yes, he is tough! Those minuscule guts of his are truly tough!
Only the strong deserve honor! Only victory brings justice, and friendship...
You are just as mesmerizing and fleeting as your bubbles!
Strength is honor... and a hero deserves respect and friendship! I will keep you in a corner of my memory for eternity, Caesar!
I'm satisfied... This was my first truly satisfying battle in a while, Hamon warrior!
You're as composed and perceptive as they come! An unparalleled Hamon warrior!
I respect your approach to battle!
Hand over the Red Stone!
Lord Esidisi... I was out of line. Please punish me however you please...
Please forgive me, Lord Esidisi!
Please forgive me, Lord Kars!
I was rude to one of my masters... Please punish me however you please.
Human life is so fleeting... Farewell, JoJo!
Thank you for giving me the chance to fight a warrior like you a third time!
I just don't understand humans...
Hm? That isn't your battle attire? Then why are you wearing it?
I still have much training to do, Lord Esidisi!
That was nothing compared to your Heat Control Mode, Lord Esidisi!
It appears I overestimated them...
Please do not waste such words on me, Lord Kars!
That was marvelous, Lord Kars!
I apologize for wasting your time like this...
Get stronger. Then you may come at Wamuu again...
Hu hu hu ha ha! I respect your weapons, guts, and ideas!
This is no longer merely a matter of avenging Lord Esidisi... I will keep you in a corner of my memory for eternity, Hamon warriors!
Master Esidisi, you were marvelous...
Shall we team up?
Now!
Allow me!
Allow me!
Let's finish this now!
Very good.
Allow me to assist you.
As you wish!
As you wish!
As you wish!
Over here!
Allow me!
Marvelous!
Such strength...
Allow me to borrow your power.
Lord Esidisi... But how?!
Lord Kars! How could this happen?!
I will remain your ally until the end, Lord Kars...
Fare...well...
Jo...Jo...
Very good.
I'll burn that stupid thing right off your head!
Heat Control Mode!
How'd you like a jet of searing hot blood!?
Burned to a crisp!
You burnt out yet?
Hmm... Your eyes are piercing me...
Fine, I'll take you on.
...
Hmph!
Live as long as I have and strange things like this are nothing!
You look just like me... but how hot does your blood run?
I like that look in your eyes... This'll be fun.
I'm going to eradicate all you Hamon warriors, just like I did 2,000 years ago!
Oh, do I sense a bit of fear? You just got scared of me, didn't you?
I'm bored. Entertain me, human.
You're not a Hamon warrior... Begone, or else you'll die the moment you touch me.
I can fire blood heated to 500℃! Hot enough to incinerate a tree or a piece of paper!
Your techniques are like child's play compared to my boiling blood!
That's some talk coming from a lowly vampire... Time to put you in your place.
Outta the way! I don't have time to deal with you.
Hmm...so piercing... You look much fiercer now... But those who meet me with an attitude like yours don't live long!
So that's Hamon, huh? I like it! C'mon! Let's play.
You're Caesar, the bubble guy, right?
Woman! I can tell you know how to fight!
Come here, my lovely! I'm going to turn your face into a sputtering stew!
I doubt I could eat you no matter how I cook you...
I want the Red Stone...now.
The "genius of battle"... A worthy opponent! I'm going to enjoy this!
You don't need to hold back, Wamuu!
My fire and your light... Let's see how they clash with each other!
Kars... What do you say we spar for the first time in 2,000 years?!
You can use flames too? Intriguing...
I can sense the heat behind you... You can't fool Esidisi of the Flames!
You have some other power aside from your Hamon, don't you?
JoJo! I never thought I'd get to fight you again!
JoJo... That's quite the outfit you've got on there.
This woman... She's a Hamon warrior?
Okay, Wamuu. I could use a fight myself.
I'm counting on you, Wamuu!
Sounds fun, Wamuu. Let me join in!
This sure brings back memories from 10,000 years ago...
Where's Wamuu?
Kars, you don't mind taking them on, do you?
You'd better entertain me, you little chickadees!
Tsk!
I'm going to kill you next!
You'd better be boiling if you aim to take me out!
Burn away, and fall into ashes...
Don't compare the great Esidisi with those feeble vampires!
I didn't think you were this strong of a Hamon warrior!
I knew you were scared.
That was fun. I haven't fought a good opponent in a while.
You can't even use Hamon... What did you expect?
I'm going to send my blood into your wounds until they boil!
Your ice can't even cool down my head...
Stop floundering and let us feast on you, vampire!
Your next line will be: "I'm going to wipe that grin right off your face!" Oh wait, you're already dead...
2000 years ago, I ran into lots of Hamon users like you. And I consumed them all!
Those bubbles of yours were a lot of fun!
You've become strong, Hamon warrior. I haven't fought an opponent like you in quite a while.
Amazing! So you're Lisa Lisa... Your Hamon is like nothing I've seen before!
I didn't think you were this strong... Shocking!
I have to say, that mechanical body of yours did surprise me a little...
Where is it? In this pocket?
Impressive, Wamuu of the Wind! Such strength! Such resolve!
Damn you, Wamuu... You went easy on me!
Sharp as always, I see! Thanks for the inside look into your Light Mode!
How unlike you. Have the past 2,000 years left you a little rusty?
Avdol, was it? Allow me to commend those flames of yours!
A Stand? Humans come up with some pretty clever things...
This old fool... I feel like I've met him somewhere before.
I managed to get the jump on you this time, JoJo!
How? You actually thought you could hide yourself in that?
Is that you, JoJo? Why are you dressed like that? Is this a hobby of yours?
Wamuu of the Wind... That was an excellent battle. I expected no less from you.
You've really polished up your Wind Mode...
I wouldn't say that. They were simply never any match for us!
I see you've still got it, Kars!
Heh heh... I knew I could count on you.
Sorry to drag you into this farce!
It was a good fight. I'm satisfied now!
Help me out!
Let's go!
Mmm!
Amusing!
I'll start this one!
Look! I'm right here!
Not bad...
Surprising.
Your power is mine now!
Wamuu! How could you let this happen?!
Kars! A man like you? How?!
Mmm!
What disgusting hair.
Red Stone of Aja!
Aaahh...
Time for a birthday present!
Bleed!
No one escapes from Kars!
Now that I've conquered the sun, I'll destroy you with Hamon!
Now that I've conquered the sun, I'll destroy you with Hamooon!
Mmm. Very nice.
Let me show you... The Ultimate Life Form has no equal!
Let me show you... The Ultimate Life Form has no equal!
Come...
Hmph.
I want you out of my sight.
You... You can use Shining Sabres?! How?!
There can be only one!
A Hamon warrior? Come! Kars will be your opponent!
I can't let a Hamon warrior like you get away!
You're walking right into the jaws of death, vampire!
I won't let you touch my allies, vampire... Not that you could...
A survivor of the Hamon clan, eh?
Watch as my Mode rips you in two!
You aren't a Hamon warrior...
Think my blades are sharp? Wait until your body feels them!
You see, Kars doesn't let himself get excited...
JoJo, this is a one-on-one match! Just as you wanted!
Don't bask in glory yet. There shall be no tomorrow for you.
Let me show you... The Ultimate Life Form has no equal!
You Hamon users like to fight fair, huh? Then let's settle this fair and square.
You're no woman in my eyes. Kars will pour every last ounce of strength he has into killing you!
A puny machine is no match for me!
Hmph... You really want to be sliced in two that badly?
Let's see what the genius of battle can do.
Charge, Wamuu!
I'm ready to take you on, Esidisi!
Esidisi! I suppose we should spar once in a while.
I've never heard of a feeble old Hamon user like you!
Now, to cast you into the dark abyss of death once and for all, JoJo!!
Watch me slowly come up to you, then pluck your life out like a flower in a field.
What a sad attempt at cross-dressing, JoJo!!
I'll be relying on that fighting spirit of yours....
Come, Wamuu. Let me show you how it's done!
Fine, Wamuu. But don't get carried away now...
Heh. And things are going to go exactly as they did back then...
I haven't seen him... But the two of us should be more than enough.
So be it. Just don't lose sight of our true goal!
JoJo... Once I retrieve the Red Stone from that soldier, you're a dead man!
A puny machine is no match for me!
I'm just as angry as you about Esidisi's death! I'm going with you, Wamuu!
Vampires! Exterminate them!
And what exactly...is a Zeppeli?
Get lost...
Tsk!
Shine! Sharpness! You lack both of those!
You really thought you could defeat the great Kars?
It'd be a waste to kill you... Allow me to grant you eternal life instead.
My Mode is Light... Shining Sabers!
Hmph! That wasn't half bad for a vampire. You'd make a fine pawn!
That's it? The same thing would have happened if you had fought the other two instead.
Your kind never learns...
Not even a focused Hamon could stop my Shining Sabres!
Go on, keep mocking me... You're incapable of anything else.
Slicing your neck is as easy as plucking a flower from the ground.
This is what true battle tastes like, JoJo!
Mmmm... What a scream! Listen to it echo! That's what I want to hear from you, JoJo!
My Shining Sabres are far sharper than your Cutter moves!
Bubbles? This shouldn't be a problem...
I'll do whatever it takes...because in the end...victory is everything!!
Fool! You think you're going to stop ME with some silly scarf!?
Now, hand over the Red Stone...
Let's see how much I can dice you up before you become completely irreparable!
You are far too pure-hearted to be a fighter...
I knew I could rely on you, Wamuu... If there's one thing I can count on, it's your fighting spirit!
Just as hot as you were 2000 years ago... I'm glad to see that, Esidisi!
I suppose after 2,000 years, it may take some time for you to warm up...
Is that you, JoJo? Humans age so quickly...
Kars is your only god now!
My, my... How the humans have fallen...
Imbecile... I'm the one who should be angry here!
I see you're still worthy of your title, Battle Genius.
This is how it's done!!
Just as long as you had fun, Wamuu...
Good to see that Esidisi of the Flames is still burning as well.
Wamuu must be out searching for the Red Stone...
What would life be without enemies? I can understand how you feel...
Now, hand over the Red Stone...
Santviento? He was a green child—nothing more than a guard dog! We are on a far higher level!!
Wamuu, now isn't the time for sentimentality... Our mission is to acquire the Red Stone!
Let's move out... Tonight, the Red Stone of Aja will be ours!
Is that it? Just as I thought... Esidisi, Wamuu, playtime is over!
Time to strike!
Ready...?
Hmm...
Fine!
Bleed!
Hu ha ha ha!
Hm, not bad.
Excellent.
And now only Kars remains...
He was far too pure-hearted to be a fighter!
Wamuu! I will avenge you!
I will not allow Esidisi's efforts to go to waste!
Esidisi, I will avenge you!
Hmm...
Your hair is such a joke I can't even think of anything to say to you.
Star Platinum!
Oraaaa!
I'm gonna smash you!
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!
ORAAA!!
You pissed me off.
I stopped time...
And I managed to escape...
Star Platinum!
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORAAA!!
You're getting an ass beating from yours truly.
When I say I'm gonna do something, it's as good as done.
You...
I got a bone to pick with you...
Let's see who's stronger.
I don't know who you are, but I don't like your attitude.
Hey, hold on. "Jonathan?" Don't tell me, you're...!
I don't hold back against anyone, not even my ancestors.
Is that you, gramps?
I don't know who you are, but your face is pissing me off.
You like sumo wrestling? Time to get this ring set up!
True evil is people like you, who stomp on the weak and abuse them!
Why are you so loyal to DIO?
Looks like I'm up against a blind man here.
You wanna go?
He looks kinda like me... No, I must be seeing things...
Chariot, huh? Guess I'd better get serious.
Doesn't this guy ever shut up?
We've both got evil spirits here, so I feel like we could be friends, but if you keep this up...you'll die.
Hmph.
Take a damn chill pill, pup.
Stupid dog...
This time you're gonna break more than your metal pinky, gramps.
Stay back... You'll just end up shortening what little life you've got left.
Kinda hard to kick your ass if I don't get close enough!
Damn you, DIO...
Get back...unless you want a few broken bones.
You think I'm your friend or something? Wait...do you have a Stand too?
Rohan Kishibe the manga artist? Never heard of him.
You're more than just a manga artist...
Gimme a break... I don't have time to mess around with idiots like you.
What are you talking about? I've never seen you before in my life.
...Move it, psycho.
Shut up! I don't wanna hear another word, you psycho!
Josuke? Never heard of him.
So that's your Stand, huh?
You thought a measly bomb was enough to scare Jotaro Kujo?
So much bloodlust... You aren't just some normal salaryman.
You're in the way. Get back, or get punched.
Are you ever gonna shut up? If you wanna fight, then let's hurry up and get this over with.
Not much surprises me anymore, but DIO's son? Damn.
This feeling... Are you a Joestar?
You a new Stand user or something, lady?
You're starting to annoy me!
All right, I've had enough of your crap, man.
I wouldn't if I were you. I don't hold back on anyone...
Another Stand user?
Hold on. I have no idea who you are...
What? I can't hear you!
What's your problem? Stop staring at me.
Another one of DIO's assassins? Why are you disguised as a priest?
You're a new Stand user, aren't you?
Hey... What the hell is wrong with you?
...Move it, psycho.
Gimme a break... You've got some problems, gramps.
No... It's called a Stand.
Hmph... Guess I know who I inherited my resilience from.
Hamon Breathing? Interesting... Show me what you can do.
Gimme a break.
You want to go with me? Why?
It's beatdown time, Kakyoin.
Huh? What are you blathering about?
Josuke, was it? Just who are you?
The most punches wins, huh?
Gimme a break... You're the last person I wanna hear that from.
Let's go, Jean Pierre...
I see you're as overblown as ever, Avdol...
Gimme a break... Who says you get to name it?
Yeah, two or three punches should do the trick.
Time for you to do some work around here, Iggy.
You're gonna help out? Guess you do come in handy after all...
Just don't keel over on me, gramps...
This is dangerous, old man. Step back.
Gimme a break... Trust me, I've had my fill.
Just shut up and start fighting.
This isn't some street fight. Leave it to me.
Fine kid, but if you get hurt, that's on you.
Focus! I don't want you getting in the way.
Can you even fight?
Looks like you've got a Stand too...
Yeah... The same goes for me.
Do you have Joestar blood or something?
We're gonna corner them.
Step down, woman.
Step down, woman.
Yeah... Don't remember introducing myself to you, though.
What's with the shock? Let's hurry up and get this over with already!
What's with the shock? Let's hurry up and get this over with already!
Sounds to me like you're a few screws loose...
Jolyne? What are you talking about?
Jolyne? What are you talking about?
Gramps... I can only handle so much of your crap.
How the hell are you gonna fight in that, old man?
Oh look, now they're teaming up. Gimme a break... This is gonna be a pain.
I don't believe this crap... He has a son?!
Who's that priest? One of DIO's underlings?
Stupid old man... What is he so worked up about?
Gimme a break... Doesn't that kid ever shut up?
Time for you to do some work around here, Iggy.
I'd better not see you running off halfway through...
Gramps and the others must have passed through here...
Don't get hasty now, Jean Pierre!
Bring it...on... DIO...
Who the hell are you guys, anyway?
Kakyoin teamed up with N'doul!?
I'm Jotaro Kujo. What's your name?
I'll introduce myself later.
Catching her is going to be the hard part...
First, we need to defeat them.
We'll just do what we did before.
Enough with the dramatic bullshit.
Whoever you are, you've got one hell of an attitude.
...
Bring it, DIO!
Get lost.
Damn you...
The same kind of Stand, huh?
Just gimme a break already...
I didn't want to fight you...
What force... I'm lucky he didn't have a Stand.
I don't know what you were planning, but I've had enough of the tricks!
Just seeing you pisses me off beyond belief.
Hmph! Not bad, Kakyoin.
The loser is the evil one. And you know what that means.
DIO has the power to make people go this crazy for him?
Relax... I went easy on you. Those wounds aren't fatal.
If you don't like attention, then quit going around looking like that, man.
Gimme a break... This guy's seriously dangerous.
I don't think I've ever been this exhausted.
Speed doesn't matter when all I need to do is punch you.
A man like you thought I was just gonna go down without a fight?
Students gotta act like proper students, right Avdol?
Ugh, what a mangy mutt!
Iggyyy... Gimme a break.
That was pathetic, old man. I can't believe you're actually my grandfather...
I didn't call for you...
Now you're all paid up, DIO!
There's only one reason you lost...just one simple reason. You pissed me off.
Koichi Hirose... I'll remember that name.
What, aren't high school students allowed to wear uniforms now?
You had a manga serialized in Jump? Yeah right...
Relax... I didn't touch your drawing hand.
That's a pretty scary ability... Too bad it's in the hands of an amateur. You can't even use it right.
How does this guy know who I am?
I hate chatterboxes...
Gimme a break... This girl's completely lost her mind!
Is that an Italian suit? Just who do you think you are, man?
Those bombs were powerful... But I think the "host" was a little out of shape.
Gimme a break... Now your bombs can rewind time?
I knew you were hiding something awful beneath that mug.
What's wrong with him? Why is he so scared?
What was that about someone being "weaker" than you? Huh?
Considering your bloodline, I was expecting a little more from your Stand...
I'm sure of it now. He and I share the same blood!
Gimme a break... Stupid brat.
...Jolyne?
Huh? Oh, you're a woman?
Gimme a break... You're one hell of a tomboy...
Jolyne? What are you talking about? Did you fry your brain or something?
I don't know who you think you are... But it sure felt good to beat you silly.
Open your mouth and speak in an outside voice, dammit!
Huh? That mark on your shoulder... But how?!
That Stand was serious trouble... I'm glad luck was on my side.
You have the ability to steal Stands...?
What are you on? Idiot...
Huh? You're a...guy?
Shut up! I don't wanna hear another word, old man!
You'll find out soon enough, gramps.
Jonathan Joestar... I'm glad I got to fight with you.
This is called a Stand... I'd remember that if I were you, ancestor.
They were no match for us...
Tch...
Did I overdo it a bit?
Just shut up. You're not making any sense.
...Gimme a break, old man!
Doesn't this guy ever shut up?
Lower your voice a bit, Jean Pierre.
That remains to be seen...
Gimme a break. We won, and you decided to give me a lecture?
Star Platinum? Hmph. Not bad, I guess.
You said it. What a bunch of losers.
Thanks.
H-here's some gum, you...you stupid mutt...
Have you gone senile? I was matching mine up to yours...
Hmph...
You're a crafty tactician, gramps...
What are you going on about?
Did he just erase space with his right hand?!
Koichi, was it? You didn't do too bad out there...
That was too easy...
You can read people's experiences? Gimme a break... Talk about a Stand with bad taste.
Gimme a break... Is manga all you ever think about?
I knew I felt his blood in you...
Hold on... What's that mark on your shoulder?!
Gimme a break...
Tch! You never shut up, do you?
Tch! You never shut up, do you?
What's that supposed to mean? I'm still in high school...
You know about my Star Platinum? Just who are you?
You know about my Star Platinum? Just who are you?
Every single thing you say creeps me out...
Enough already! Do you want me to beat you to a pulp?!
Enough already! Do you want me to beat you to a pulp?!
Wait, that outfit isn't just some stupid joke? Gimme a break...
Heh... I can't believe you can actually fight in that thing.
Now you're all paid up, DIO...for everything you've done over the last 100 years!
Gimme a break.
Wait... Did you just say disc? Is it like a cassette?
They aren't the kind of opponents you can play around with...
Very mature, gramps...
H-here's some gum... Stupid mutt... He's actually pretty strong...
Take a damn chill pill, pup.
Damn it. Now it's getting interesting.
I told them that impulsive idiots like you should just be left to their own devices, but gramps and Kakyoin insisted that I team up with you... That's why I'm here!
How do you feel now? DIO...
Gimme a break... Why did you jackasses have to put us through all that?
Pfft. If we could only get closer, it'd be a piece of cake...
You're not half bad.
Things will never end at this rate... Bring out the boss already!
What's wrong? You two done already?
Gimme a break...... They're both close-range power types?
Gimme a break... That's one hell of a Stand...
I'm not hearing your lecture too well... Can you speak up a bit?
Gimme a break. So good so far, but here's where the real problem starts...
So this is your reality or whatever, DIO?
Join me on this one!
Ready for this?
...Now!
Hmph!
Yeah, I know.
Over here!
Allow me!
Guess you can fight a little.
Guess you're not totally useless.
Leave the rest to me!
...Kakyoin!
How dare you... Jean Pierre!
Leave the rest to me, Avdol!
I'll avenge you!
Gramps' soul...
Hmph!
We can talk about your stupid haircut later.
Star Platinum!
I'm gonna smash you!
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!
ORAAA!!
You pissed me off.
ORAAAA!!
Prepare yourself...
I stopped time...
And I managed to escape...
Star Platinum!
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORAAA!!
I'll take you on...
If you want a fight, I'll give you a fight.
Jackass...
I got a bone to pick with you...
What's your problem?
Hmph... This'll be tricky.
...Jonathan? Wait, you must be...
Never thought I'd ever have to fight my ancestor...
Guess you've never had any self-control...
Granny Suzie Q's never been angrier in her entire 61 years of marriage...
Long time no see, Kakyoin...
I knew you'd be able to recognize me, Kakyoin.
Sure brings back memories, Jean Pierre...
Gimme a break... Don't you ever calm down?
Hmph... There's that overblown tone I remember, Avdol...
Not only did you know it was me, but you could tell that I've aged?
Seems like you've realized who I am, Iggy...
Wait, Iggy! It's me!
It's been a while since I've seen you standing straight up, gramps...
Pfft. Some talk, from a guy who had the nerve to cheat on his wife at the age of 65...
Gimme a break... This time I'm gonna pummel your ashes too, DIO!
Guess we still aren't square yet, DIO...
Time to pay you back for making my hat fly off, N'doul.
Your ears are just as sharp as ever.
Hold it, Josuke! I wasn't trying to insult you...
Time to test out your stand, Josuke... Follow me.
True observation means seeing with your mind, not your eyes...to listen with your heart, not your ears...
A Stand's power comes from mental strength, Koichi.
Rohan Kishibe... If you want to read me, you're gonna have to work for it.
I'm gonna punch you before you can draw anything.
What are you on about, Okuyasu?
Fine. Okuyasu, bring out your Stand!
No, I haven't seen him, but...
Shut up and stop annoying me, you psycho!
That's a nice watch, but I'm going to break it so you can't tell time anymore... And by "it," I mean your face.
I call dibs on busting him up.
So you're Yoshikage Kira... Looks like your luck's run out.
This is bad! We need to get closer somehow...
If you were me, would you just walk out with your hands up?
Go ahead, try something with your Stand. I'll chase you to the ends of the earth and snuff you out!
You're... Haruno Shiobana?
If you know me, then let's cut to the chase. Bring it, Giorno Giovanna...
Could you be... Jolyne?!
Joyne...Cujoh?! It can't be!
Who are you? Why do you know my daughter's name?
She knows who I am?
Did you just say "Jolyne"?
What are you saying...?
Who are you? And why are you coming after me?
Did you just say "DIO"?
Hey, Gramps... What gives?
You're getting on my nerves... Time to shut you up, lady.
My grandfather is Joseph Joestar... Your grandson.
Is this that Hamon stuff that gramps can use?
Hey, don't go out too far ahead of me.
I knew I'd be able to count on this version of you...
Just watch, Kakyoin...
Just watch, Kakyoin...
I'm not that old yet.
Watch my back, Jean Pierre.
You got it, Avdol.
Hmph... You sound like my uncle or something.
You're gonna listen to me now, you hear?
Time for you to help out, Iggy.
I'll tell you once we finish this battle.
Heh... I'm counting on you, old man!
Josuke, don't let your guard down.
Put some effort into it, Josuke!
Ready, Josuke?
Your Stand can still get stronger... Use your head when you fight, Okuyasu.
Watch the enemy with your mind, Okuyasu... Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah. You do the smashing, Okuyasu!
Carefully watch your opponent's movements, okay?
Get back, Koichi!
Sync your fighting style with mine, okay, Koichi?
You think you're gonna have the time to do that?
You sure you should be fighting? What if you injure your arm?
No... Let's team up here, Giorno.
So, you're Haruno Shiobana...
I never thought I'd get to fight with you like this, Jolyne...
Jolyne, get back!
You're Jolyne's friend, aren't you?
The me that you know must be even older than I am now...
Who the hell are you?
None of your business.
Have you gone senile, gramps?
Wait, are you trying to distract the enemy with that?
Move farther away, Koichi!
Finally decided to show yourself, huh Yoshikage Kira?
This is Yoshikage Kira!
This is bad! We need to get closer somehow... Even if I stop time, we'll still be too far from him... We won't make it!
The next time we meet, you're done for.
Get lost already.
The same kind of Stand, huh?
Gimme a break... I'm just glad I managed to win.
He's calm, but powerful... What a beast.
What power... He's just like I used to be...or maybe even stronger?
Stop making grandma mad, you old fool...
Gimme a break... I warned you, didn't I?
I'm glad I got to see you again.
I'll never forget you, man.
Heh... I thought you wouldn't notice.
A school uniform would really be pushing it at this age.
Looks like I've definitely grown strong enough to beat the crap out of you.
I missed you, Avdol...
Here, Iggy. Gum was your favorite, right?
Damn... He stuck gum on me and attacked at the same time? This mutt's a genius...
Relax. You haven't gone senile...yet.
"I'll love only my wife, until the day I die." You sounded like a saint when you said that... What happened?
Gimme a break... I practically need to have luck on my side to beat him now.
You're all paid up...for real this time.
No way was I gonna let you blow off my hat a second time...
Relax... I went easy on you again.
Gimme a break... This guy's seriously dangerous.
What power! You've gotten even stronger than before, Josuke.
Remember what I said, or you'll be in for a world of hurt, Koichi.
You got stronger during that battle? Impressive...
See, there are some memories I need to keep private...
A fighting manga artist... You're actually pretty dangerous.
If you honed it a bit more, that could become a crazy powerful Stand.
Not even Josuke can fix what The Hand destroys... Scary stuff.
Gimme a break... You're out of control.
Koichi sure knows how to pick 'em...
You know, that watch actually looked pretty crappy... Not that it matters now.
I've never met a Stand this tough before.
You've lost the right to live a peaceful life.
Guess I made it in time...
Whoa there, don't collapse just yet. I've got a lot of questions for you regarding the bow and arrow.
Don't you ever come around here again.
You're stronger than I thought you'd be. No wonder you gave Koichi trouble.
Ever since I found out about you, I've been prepared for this day.
I don't expect you to understand, but...
You've really become a strong woman, Jolyne.
Why do these thugs keep approaching me?
She has a Stand? Good thing I defeated her, then.
Who is this guy? And why does he know my daughter?
Are you nuts? Jolyne's only 6 years old.
Gimme a break... You're connected to DIO too?
It doesn't seem like he's just another one of DIO's underlings, though... Who could he be?
I knew it was you the moment I laid eyes on you. I didn't even have to look with my mind.
Huh? You're a...guy?
Jonathan Joestar... I'm glad I got to fight with you.
It's a Stand... Also known as a "Spirit Hamon".
Well, I can't exactly let you die, now can I?
You know, the young you does sorta look like Josuke.
It's been ten whole years. I must have grown a little.
It's been ten whole years. I must have grown a little.
Star Platinum is just as strong as ever.
Silver Chariot's really got some moves...
I won't wither that easily.
I turned 28 this year, Avdol.
Don't you ever stop moving? It helped me out, though...
Coffee-flavored gum, was it? Here, have a piece.
Two years ago, you had gallstone surgery. You're suffering from cataracts, and you have false teeth...
In ten years, you'll be a shadow of your former self.
Go on, say something to him... Give him a snappy one-liner!
Josuke's a reliable guy, so I wasn't really worried.
Man, your power... I feel bad for whoever's on the receiving end of that.
You could get even stronger if you'd only use your head...
Gimme a break... Why do I even bother?
I guess not using your head was the right decision, Okuyasu.
I knew I could count on you.
Koichi, you've really grown.
I knew you were the right man for the job, Koichi.
...Gimme a break.
Guess you won't have go on hiatus now.
Sorry... I was only seeing you as DIO's son, rather than what you really are.
Guess it's about time I tell you what happened between me and DIO...
Jolyne, you were the one person I wanted to keep out of this...
You're pretty violent, you know that?
You're a trustworthy ally. Take care of Jolyne for me.
I'll remember that...
Thanks, Anastasia. I owe you one.
Are you nuts? What the hell is wrong with you?
Gimme a break... I'm just glad I managed to win.
You cross-dress, and you cheat on your wife. I've really had it with you, old man...
I hate things that are a pain in the ass... So I'm just going to bust him up.
Koichi... I would have lost if it wasn't for you. You were amazing out there.
Koichi... I knew I could rely on you. I'm glad that I got to meet you.
Well, looks like I made it in time... ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!
Join me on this one!
Don't fall behind.
Let me handle this.
Yeah!
Over here!
Allow me!
Not too shabby.
I knew you had it in you.
You're with me now!
Josuke!
You did well. Now leave the rest to me.
You fought hard, Koichi!
Yeah!
Aren't you ever gonna get a new haircut?
Star Platinum!
I'm gonna smash you!
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!
ORAAA!!
You pissed me off.
I stopped time...
And I managed to escape...
Star Platinum!
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORAAA!!
Gimme a...break.
If you want a fight, I'll give you a fight.
Jackass...
So be it...
What's your problem?
Hmph... This'll be tricky.
So you're Jonathan Joestar...
You may not believe this, but I'm your descendant.
Never thought I'd hear a half-dead geezer call me an old man...
Guess I can't really call you gramps now, can I?
Is that you, Kakyoin?!
Gimme a break... He doesn't realize it's me, does he?
Gimme a break... Now I have to take you on, Jean Pierre?
I have to go up against your Chariot? Gimme a break... This is gonna be a pain.
Avdol... Never thought I'd get to see you again.
Wanna try me, Avdol?
Guess you recognized my scent.
Can you tell it's me, Iggy?
Heh... Guess you haven't gone senile yet.
You immediately recognized me? Guess I should've known...
Hmph. I still have enough power to stamp you out, DIO...
I want you tell me all you know about that Pucchi guy.
N'doul... You're still alive?
You noticed me approaching? Guess your senses are as sharp as ever...
It's just your imagination.
Only one way to find out, isn't there?
Time to show me how your Stand training's been going.
Yeah, it's true, I guess.
Remember, if you want to read me, you're gonna have to work for it.
Gimme a break... I can't lose to this guy.
Gimme a break... I may have gotten older, but I don't plan on getting weaker.
I guess Okuyasu hasn't noticed that I've gotten a bit older...
Are you talking to me...?
I'm pretty sure this is the girl with the short fuse that kept following Koichi around...
I'm gonna crush you right here, before anything else happens.
I already know how Deadly Queen works, Yoshikage Kira...
Yoshikage Kira... I'm gonna smash you all over again.
Fate's on your side? Don't make me laugh, you butcher.
Sorry, but who are you again?
Otoishi, was it? You got out of the slammer already?
You shouldn't be asking me that...
Gimme a break... You became the boss of a gang at that age?
Did your mother give you the pendant I left with her, Jolyne?
Listen to what I say, Jolyne.
Gimme a break... I'm not going easy on you.
Is that sticker your Stand?
What did you just say?
You want to marry...Jolyne?
I was one move...too late...!
I sure owe you for taking such good care of my daughter...
You're not making any sense...
Hey, Gramps... What gives?
We're bound to win if we team up.
I can't... But my grandpa can.
Yeah, I'll be counting on you too.
Don't let me down, old man.
You don't need to get all uptight, Kakyoin.
It's been a while since we fought together...
It's been a while since we fought together...
Same here, Jean Pierre!
Never thought I'd see you act so considerate towards me... What a weird feeling.
Never thought I'd see you act so considerate towards me... What a weird feeling.
I'm going on the attack. Back me up...
Ready to smash some heads, Avdol?
Ready to smash some heads, Avdol?
What was that one thing you loved, Iggy?
Never thought I'd get to fight with you again, Iggy!
Never thought I'd get to fight with you again, Iggy!
I suppose it's about time I showed you how much battle experience I've racked up...
Gimme a break... You're the last person I want to hear that from.
Gimme a break... You're the last person I want to hear that from.
Stay focused, Josuke.
You don't need to worry about my age...
Think and decide for yourself... Got it?
Stop flapping your gums, and let's go!
Let's team up here, Koichi.
What's wrong, Koichi? You're acting like you did when we first met...
Why are so many people interested in what I've got inside my head?
What are you prattling about? Let's go.
You take the rear, Giorno.
Let's go, Haruno Shiobana. Err, Giorno Giovanna...
Will you fight with me, Jolyne?
Do you have a Stand ability? Use that to fight.
More enemies... Don't worry, I know you can make it through this.
Yeah, but I trust you. Don't let me down.
Ready for this, Ermes?
Just ignore me and move!
Hey now, Anastasia...
They're right in front of us. Let's move.
Now's not the time for that.
...Have you lost your mind, gramps?
Are you trying to break the enemy's concentration?
He dodged the lance?! But how...
Can you feel that, Jolyne? That's HIM!
What did you just say?
Anastasia... Your Stand...
Hmph...
Tsk!
The same kind of Stand, huh?
Just gimme a break already...
I've inherited your will, Jonathan...
I knew I could get you to believe me, Jonathan Joestar.
You can't even beat me when you're young? What a joke.
At my age, I really have to struggle to beat you...
I've missed you, Kakyoin.
I haven't fought you since that one time. We had a lot of fun, didn't we?
I haven't forgotten a thing about you...including the way you fight.
My body may have withered, but my mind is a sharp as ever, Jean Pierre.
Now I don't have to listen to you lecture me anymore.
Gimme a break. Reminds me of my time in the lockup.
Follow me, Iggy. I'll buy you some coffee gum.
Gimme a break... You forgot who I am, didn't you?
I wanna study you...and see how you're able to fight so well at that age.
Can you stand up, gramps? I just can't help but fight at full strength against you...
Stay dead this time, DIO.
Your friend? DIO actually made friends with a human?
I wish I could get you to stop living for DIO... But I guess it's too late.
Gimme a break... At least I prevented you from blowing my hat off this time.
Guess my Stand hasn't gotten rusty after all. That was some good practice.
Mental strength is what influences Stand power, Josuke.
Are you feeling under the weather? I know you're stronger than that.
Heh... You have good observation skills, but you need to work on your concentration a little more, Koichi.
See, there are some memories I need to keep private...
You can control your opponent at will just by writing stuff with your Stand? Talk about a pain in the ass enemy...
This is what I meant by a difference in experience, Okuyasu.
Guess I don't need to say anything.
Gimme a break... Guess I can't really argue with her, though.
Gimme a break... You're as annoying as ever.
As long as I know how your Stand ability works, you'll never get the jump on me.
I won't give you time to steal Kawajiri's identity!
Prepare to be judged in hell, you monster...
Your only fate...is to get run over, Yoshikage Kira.
Oh, Akira Otoishi... The electric guy from Morioh Town?
Gimme a break... Guess you're not totally reformed yet...
Ally or enemy? It's your choice.
You're free to walk the path you believe in, Giorno. But if that path happens to lead to grotesque evil...
Gimme a break... I'm going to get you out of here, though. That's why I came...
You need to get out of here at once. That's why I came. Got it?! Just ignore the law!
Well? What did you think of Star Platinum?
Your Stand may be as destructive as Star Platinum!
You're not making any sense... Did that fight drive you nuts or something?
Don't ever come near Jolyne again.
The knives are already falling!! Pucchi already threw them into the air...just like DIO once did!!
You'll be going there alone... Not to Heaven, but Hell!
...Is it the dementia?
You know, I thought after all I've seen nothing could ever surprise me again, but...
I'm proud to have fought with you, Jonathan Joestar.
It's a Stand... A vision created from vital energy.
My grandfather's younger than me now... What a strange feeling.
I'm not that old yet.
Hmph... Stop goofing around.
It feels like we're back in Egypt.
It feels like we're back in Egypt.
It was all thanks to your backup, Jean Pierre.
Gimme a break... Just stop acting weird already.
Gimme a break... Just stop acting weird already.
You're still gonna lecture me, after all these years? ...Gimme a break.
Heh... When I say I'll do something, it's as good as done.
Heh... When I say I'll do something, it's as good as done.
I remember now... Coffee-flavored gum. I'll give you some later.
I knew I could count on you, Iggy.
I knew I could count on you, Iggy.
Gimme a break... I never could out-trick him.
I've learned a lot from watching you fight at your age.
I've learned a lot from watching you fight at your age.
I knew I could count on you, Josuke.
We can't let that old fool show us up.
You've grown a bit, Okuyasu.
Gimme a break... Stop treating me like an old man!
You've always been there to help me.
...What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry, but I don't remember making that promise.
Can't let myself wither just yet...
I'm sure of it now... You're definitely a Joestar.
Yeah, same here. Thanks, Giorno Giovanna.
If Jolyne's mind is this powerful, then...
I've always cherished you...
Jolyne... Well done.
I see Jolyne found herself some trustworthy friends.
I was a bit better in my prime, though.
You exceeded my expectations.
Don't ever mention that to me again.
Gimme a break... Does nothing faze this guy?
You think I need you to tell me that?
You're still young. You should be able to fight fine without all that stuff.
Gimme a break... I guess we've reached a new dawn for the human race.
You've become a fine woman, Jolyne...
What's going to happen to his ability next? Even he's eager to see what it's truly capable of...
You're not making any sense... Are you insane?
Gotcha! Take this, Father Pucchi!!
Here goes.
Don't fall behind.
Very good.
Yeah!
Over here!
I'll take this.
Guess you can fight a little.
Not too bad.
Let me borrow your strength!
No! Jolyne!!
Leave the rest to me.
Anastasia!
Yeah!
My hairstyle's a lot more refined than yours.
Hierophant Green!
Hadn't you noticed the barrier?
Emerald Splash!!
No more hesitation. Prepare yourself!
I'll kill you before the sun goes down...with my Stand!
Hoo...
Hmm...
My name is Noriaki Kakyoin.
No need to say it twice.
You won't get close to me that easily, Jotaro.
Those who lose are evil, and those who win are just... They're the ones who get to survive. The means to the end don't matter.
No more hesitation. Prepare yourself!
Enemy stand, incoming!
So that Stand belongs to you... Time to pay you back for that wound you gave me.
There are more ways to fight than simply smacking swords together, you know.
You can make your own coffee, dammit!
Don't think I'll hold back, Avdol.
I need to keep my eyes on the flames around Magician's Red...
Damn it! Looks like you don't remember me...
Iggy? Why are you howling so much?
Very well. If this is part of my training.
Here I come...
Urggh! Haa, haa, haa!! Gggh...
No matter what happens... I have no regrets.
You scumbags! You'll pay for this!
Time to avenge Avdol!
Wait...is that you, Jotaro?!
Jotaro... Are you in your late 20s now?
Jotaro, is that you?! What happened to you?
I don't know who you are, but if you intend to stand in my way, then I will defeat you!
Where's Hermit Purple? Oh right, you still can't use it yet...
Should I keep calling you Mr Joestar...?
Let's go!
Honestly, I don't really know why I decided to go with you.
Let's make them regret ever challenging us!
I see London, I see France!
The two of us will defeat you!
Never underestimate your enemy, Jean Pierre!
Yes, I'll do my best, Avdol!
They've got two on their side as well... Stay alert!
Wait! Please wait, Avdol!
Mr Joestar, if I may... I know my own limits. I'm no fool.
Please keep your age in mind here, Mr Joestar!
Time to give them a taste of our fighting style!
Will you listen to me this time?
Just how am I supposed to deal with this dog?
Should I keep calling you Mr Joestar...?
Mr Joestar... Why are you dressed like that?
So, how's Star Platinum been?
So, how's Star Platinum been?
For some reason, I feel like I should be calling YOU "Mr Joestar" now...
It's a bit strange to hear that from you.
It's a bit strange to hear that from you.
Jean Pierre! Please don't let him taunt you!
Think of a strategy that doesn't involve sacrificing yourself!
Jean Pierre, attack the enemy!
Jean Pierre, attack the canteen!
I'll make it so that no one will notice it, just like in the old days. If I completely erase my presence, I should be able to figure out what DIO's really capable of!
If we can just creep a little bit closer to him, I'll sure we'll find a chance to strike.
Impossible. You'll never get near us.
Unbelievable.
You make me want to puke.
You're no match for me.
Heh. Is that it?
Yeah, I love sumo. But you can't use your fists in sumo, Jotaro.
Whoever loses is the evil one.
You have an even wider range than my Hierophant... And you're strong, too!
Heh... I won't lose to the same opponent twice.
As long as I stay out of range, I've got the decisive advantage.
S-Sorry... I shouldn't have gotten that upset over coffee.
Well done, Avdol... Your power is amazing.
Those flames are something else! That was really close!
Iggy... Don't you know who I am?
Finally, he's calmed down...
Dear me! Are you alright, Mr Joestar?!
You know, I think I could learn from the way you distance yourself from foes.
I'll never return to the pathetic Kakyoin that I used to be!
I got it! T-time! He can stop time!
What a bunch of clowns. Don't you realize we know exactly how you work?
Avdol!
You clearly look older than me! What's going on here?
What happens to me in my 20s? Please tell me, Jotaro!
Is an enemy Stand power affecting Jotaro somehow?
His power, his speed... He feels just like Jotaro!
Even without a Stand, you're more than powerful enough!
That wish will come true someday, Mr. Joestar.
Yes... This battle ended far too quickly.
You awakened me. That's all.
This will be a cinch. I feel bad for our opponents, though.
Yeah!
Your movements are easy to read, Jean Pierre, so backing you up is quite simple.
Do I really need to say anything?
Your flames are so fierce, I feel like they're going to burn me as well.
Magician's Red almost toasted me, you know.
You know, Avdol, I was going to remind you that your Stand's flames are too powerful for their own good, but...
Please, don't mention another word, Mr Joestar. I was merely doing my duty.
What did I tell you?! C'mon, steady now!
Hierophant and Hermit... If I were them, I wouldn't challenge us again.
We won thanks to you, Iggy!
Here's some coffee-flavored gum! I brought an entire box.
No thanks... I'll pass.
I don't really think it's the makeup you should be worried about...
Feels like you've become a better partner than ever, Jotaro!
Feels like you've become a better partner than ever, Jotaro!
We did it! We won, Mr Jotaro!
No matter how old you get, you really never change, Jotaro...
No matter how old you get, you really never change, Jotaro...
What should we do with this guy?
You'll atone with your own death!
I don't like this, either!
Don't force others to do what you wouldn't do yourself!
Time... He can stop time...
I finally figured it out. The perfect way to unveil DIO's ability...
I told you already...you'll never get near us.
Assist me!
Together now!
Here I go!
Here I go!
Avdol!
Take it away!
Got it!
Understood!
Understood!
I got your back!
I'll be the decoy!
I'll go first!
I knew you were powerful.
Such power!
I'll get them for this!
No! Jotaro!!
I don't believe this... Jean Pierre!
N-No way!
Yes!
Here, let me give you that head of yours a killer cut!
Silver Chariot!
Let me show you my true speed!
How about that swordplay? Impressed, non?
Non non non non non non!
Guess I got sloppy!
I'll skewer you just like those coins!
Woowee! I bet you can take a beating!
That's it...
Don't hold me back!
You think you can take MOI in a swordfight?
I don't get what's going on, but this is serious!
I'm gonna go full speed, Jotaro!
I can't beat you in power... But what about speed, Jotaro?!
That Hierophant of yours isn't geared for head-to-head combat, is it?
Hey, where's my coffee? Hurry it up!
You think I'm gonna lose?!
I got a prophecy for you, Avdol. You're gonna be done in by your own Stand's power!
Now you're really gonna get it, you snarling cur!
You foul beast! I'm gonna teach you! Bring it on!!
Monsieur Joestar, your left hand isn't by chance a right, is it?
I respect you, Mr Joestar, but that doesn't mean I'll go easy on you!
Right now, I feel like I'm on the "light" side. I feel courage brimming up... I'm on the light side, the side of justice!
There you are, DIO!
If I gotta beat you before I can see that bastard, then that's what I'll do. En garde!
Huh? Excuse me? Who are you?
This is for Kakyoin and Avdol!
Water? Ha! I'll dice up whatever you throw at me!
Come at me, you cur! I'll slice you up!
Who the heck is this? Where did he come from?
Who are you? I don't think I've seen you before!
I shouldn't get too close to this guy. I don't even know what his ability is...
I get the feeling those zippers of yours are more than just for show!
A gang of Stand users? Now that sounds like trouble!
Is that the same type of Stand as Hol Horse's?
It doesn't matter how many shots you fire. I'll smack 'em all down, sniper...
C'mon... I'll make your Stand into a hanging ornament!
I'm gonna swat that thing to the ground!
Huh? Have we met somewhere before?
You've got some beautiful legs!
I'm at the top, and you're at the bottom!
This ability...it can control time! Damn you, Diavolo!
This ability...it can control time! Damn you, Diavolo!
Could that be...Jotaro?!
Why are you dressed like that, Jotaro?!
Step aside unless you wanna get hurt, old man!
I bet Star Platinum's slower than it used to be. Go on, prove me wrong!
What are you talking about, Mr Joestar? I'm right here!
Is that you, Mr Joestar?! What happened to you?!
Let's see who can get the most punches in!
Don't just charge in on your own, Jotaro!
OK... I'll slice 'em up!
Yeaaah!
Attention all enemies before us!
You think I don't know that?!
Silver Chariot plus...
Avdol, you seem a bit different...
I'm totally prepared for this, Avdol!
Think you can keep up with my speed, Mr Joestar?
Sure is a relief to have you watching my back, Mr Joestar!
Take the rear, grandpa!
Iggy! Watch my back!
You want me to fight with this mangy mutt?!
Iggy, use your sense of smell to find the enemy!
Who's THIS guy?!
I'll be counting on that Stand of yours, Giorno!!
Your name is Bucciarati, right? Let's do this!
Do you have a Stand too?
Hey, kid! Respect your elders!
Whoa, what? Do I know you or something, kid?
A pistol, huh? I don't think I like that...
What turtle? I think you've got the wrong guy...
You can fight? Don't push yourself too hard!
Your name is Trish? You're gorgeous...
Mr Joestar... How are you gonna fight in that?
Why hello there, my dear! How about a cup of tea afterwards?
Don't tell me your bones have gotten weak, Jotaro!
Leave this one to me, Jotaro!
You may be old, but you're still JOTARO, right? I'm counting on you!
I got your back, Jotaro!
I got your back, Jotaro!
A...Avdol!
What the?! He changed the trajectory!
You son of a...!
You expect me to just swallow this humiliation and run?!
No need to remind me, Avdol...
What is this guy?! He just showed up outta nowhere!
What should I do? Isn't there any way to stop him?!
Iggy! Watch my back, and I'll watch yours!
Forget that! Just feed him some of your Emerald Splash!
M-me...?
Hurry, Jotaro!
Even if we don't know what DIO's ability is, there's still one way to stop him—pure assassination!
Avdol and Iggy died saving my life. I should be the one to slice up these lousy fakes!
This time, I'll cut you into so many pieces you'll never be able to come back again!
I never wanna see your face again!
You're nothing but a nuisance!
Guess I was the stronger one. And certainly the most handsome!
Nice sword work. That was a little dangerous...
Phew! I'm beat!
My longer reach was the deciding factor!
Don't worry... It was but a flesh wound!
I only asked you to get me some coffee! What's the big deal?
Be a man, Avdol! Show me what you got!
Hu ha ha! Just as prophesized. You're going to be burned alive by your own flames!
Quite the stubborn one! It's about time you learn to be a bit more obedient!
Dirty dog! Perhaps now you understand!
I shouldn't have asked in the first place. Pardonnez-moi!
You're too old for this crap, Mr Joestar.
That was scarier than death! Imagine, living only to serve the likes of you...
Back to hell with you, DIO! Hooooo!
Swords beat guns any day! Well, they do if you're me, that is!
You really thought I couldn't deflect your measly bullets?
Is it really that fun to be used by someone?
That Stand of yours is pretty sharp! Not as sharp as Chariot, though.
His very soul is as empty as a void! A pitch black crevasse cracking open within his heart!
Go to Hell.
I feel like I've known you somewhere before... have we met?
Does this guy know me?
Strong, fast...and those zippers... Don't you think that Stand of yours is a little overpowered?
Where did you learn my name?
Don't call me by name. I don't know who the hell you are.
Get it now? Swords beat guns any day!
T-Turtle?! How can you say that to this handsome face?
Shouldn't you be in school? Keep skipping, and you'll only turn into a deadbeat!
I'd never forget a cute girl like you.
Geez, I just wanted to talk to you! Chill out, okay?
That was close... His skill was almost up there with The World!
I'm really glad I kept up with my sword training... Otherwise I'd never be able to slice up monsters like you!
Stop lying! You're obviously older than me now!
It's been a while since I've seen you out of your school uniform. I guess the last time was in Aswan?
Huh? Why does this guy know my name?
Seems like you've gotten a little bit slower, Jotaro!
Guess you couldn't use your Stand back then... And you've still got your left hand, too!
Whoa! Did you get hit by a Stand that can make people younger? Damn, where's it hiding?!
Hah! Did you see my Chariot's moves just now, Jotaro?!
You really thought you could beat Jotaro and I?!
I'm glad I had you on my side, Jotaro!
Yeah!
Thanks for the Hierophant backup!
There's no way you could best my swordsmanship. Right, Kakyoin?
Not in a million years!!
The old Avdol would have never done something dirty like this! Heh heh heh! Don't tell me it's because you got shot in the head?
See, I didn't have to worry about saving anyone! We totally won, Avdol!
Maybe I overdid it a bit...
What a fight! That's my Mr Joestar...
I can definitely tell you've done your share of training!
Well done! I'll bring you some gum next time, Iggy!
Wait, Iggy! Stop pulling my hair out!
You're a jerk, but you sure know how to fight, Iggy!
I've never seen you before in my life!
Requiem... There's something beyond normal Stand power?!
I hope we can fight again someday, Bucciarati.
Your name is Bucciarati, right? What do you know about me?
What's wrong with calling a kid a kid, kid?!
Now you've got me curious! Tell me what you know!
Just don't say "Guns are stronger than swords," whatever you do!
Hey, explain it so that even I can understand!
Wow! You're a lot stronger than that pretty face suggests.
I want to know more about you... How about going for a cup of tea?
Your makeup is weird, yeah, but you're just way too buff to begin with!
Gyaaaaaaah! This she's a HE?!
You haven't gotten the least bit rusty!
Heh! Your Star Platinum is also just as powerful as it always was!
You really are strong, man.
Tch! I was trying to be polite, you know, Mr. Jotaro!
Tch! I was trying to be polite, you know, Mr. Jotaro!
Worried? Oh, come on! Don't start up with the lectures again!
Tch! I never asked for your help! Stop doting on me!
I'll give him his sentence: Death penalty!
Here's what you say...
Shut up! That was just payback for India!
That hurt, Avdol! What'd you punch me for? Just shove me like you always do!!
I'm going to snap your shoulders and splay you open like a fish!
The next time you open that rotten mouth of yours, you're finished!!
Don't force others to do what you wouldn't do yourself! Who do you think you are?!
Why?! You're the closer one, Kakyoin! Just feed him some of your Emerald Splash!
So that's The World!
Jotaro!
These flames, this sand... They both feel like...
Now make sure you go to hell this time!
Time to dice you up!
Help me out!
Yeah!
Let the master work!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
Me first!
Bravo!
Perfect!
I'm the only one left now?!
No! Jotaro!!
They got Kakyoin! Nooo!
You're such a pain.
Why did you have to die near me?! Don't put me in this position!
Just you wait, Mr Joestar!
You had to go and play the hero!
Yeah!
I bet that hair of yours would burn right up.
Magician's Red!
I'll vaporize you!
Eat this!
Cross Fire Hurricane Special!
That's it? Elementary!
Let me tell your fortune with my flame.
My Stand is called Magician's Red precisely because it can manipulate flames as it pleases!
Hmph...
You fool!
It is prophesized... You will lose against me.
Damned fake! Let me burn that facade off of you.
Ggh... I'm being overwhelmed...by heat?
What heat! Is this your Stand?!
Things are about to get a little rough!
Jotaro, aren't you getting a little hot in those clothes? Heh heh heh.
That man's voice... it calms my heart. That's why he scares me so much!
To run from you would mean running from my entire life. And I'll never run again!
You sure about this, Kakyoin? My flames won't go easy on you!
I'll need to keep my guard up around your Hierophant...
Many go out for wool and come home shorn! You need to think carefully, Jean Pierre!
Such amazing sword skill... But you think you can beat me? That's your ego talking!
Whoa, Iggy! Cut it out!
No! No more coffee-flavored gum for you!
Mr Joestar... I'm happy to oblige, if you must, but are you sure you want to fight?
I won't hold back, then...
I'll burn away all of your bullets!
His partner should be hiding somewhere nearby.
It's sound! He's tracking our sounds so he can attack us!
A water Stand? My Magician's Red will vaporize you in a flash!
Woman! My flames will burn you right up!
This woman can control magnetism?!
Who in the world is this guy?! He just appeared out of nowhere!
Monster! Time to incinerate you!
Jotaro, show me how you've grown!
Is that you, Jotaro? You look 10 years older...
That voice... Don't tell me, you're...!
I suppose time has the power to soften even you, Jotaro.
Mr Joestar, please allow me to sample your strength.
Mr Joestar... What happened to you?
Jotaro! Don't act like this has nothing to do with you!
I name your Stand: Star Platinum!
Let's hurry up and finish this, Jotaro!
I will be going out at full strength! Stay right behind me, Kakyoin!
Put all your heart into it, Kakyoin!
Incinerate them! Magician's Red!
Magician's Red!
Go on, laugh! A big, fat, belly-laugh. That'll get you through anything!
Don't try to save anyone...okay?
Mr Joestar... Things are about to get a little rough!
What's the meaning of this, Mr Joestar?!
Of course, Mr Joestar... As if we'd ever lose.
I finally captured you... Now it's time for you to help out, Iggy!
You're the helper they sent? But you're not going to listen to a word I say, are you?
Please... Enough with the bad jokes.
Yes, I think it's a fine costume, Mr Joestar!
I trust you still possess the same power you did back then?
How old are you now, Jotaro?
Heh heh. I see you haven't lost those violent emotions of yours.
I trust Star Platinum is still a force to be reckoned with, Jotaro?
I trust Star Platinum is still a force to be reckoned with, Jotaro?
I knew I had a right to be worried! Stop overestimating yourself, Jean Pierre!
Out of the way, Jean Pierre! I'm going to burn them up!
There... She's the one...
Magician's Red!
Neither Iggy's nose nor my flames could detect him! He just appeared out of nowhere!
Who in the world is this guy?!
I won't try to save you... So I don't want you to try to save me. If we get stuck trying to help each other, we risk being annihilated!
Jean Pierre!! Watch out!
It's sound! He's tracking our sounds so he can attack us!
Tch, tch! Sounded like I was walking, didn't it?
We will exterminate anyone who stands in the way of the Noble One...
My hellfire will immolate you!
Tsk!
I hold you in great contempt!
I shouldn't have bothered even predicting this.
Looks like I should call you NostraDUMBASS. You're a lousy prophet, and Stand user too!
I can't believe you can actually make your blood boil... Impressive!
No, wait! This man...he isn't human!
Amazing... You brought it out in such vivid form!
Did my heat get to you?
I won? Now that's what I call luck!
Now, to immolate you!
That was close... Your range is incredible!
It's hard to tone down my flames...
See why I was worried? Stop overestimating yourself, Jean Pierre!
You really thought you could defeat a fortuneteller like me in a battle of prophecies? Not in a million years...
I should have known that you couldn't join us!
No more coffee gum until you start behaving!
Dear me! Are you alright, Mr Joestar?!
Thank you for this victory, Mr Joestar.
What's wrong? Your smoke's burnt out. Need a light?
Your bullets alone aren't enough!
He's strong... That was a close one.
He's gone... My flames must have burnt up every last trace of him.
She really was a fearsome opponent...
My flames can melt even steel itself!
You'd have to get up pretty early in the morning to beat me!
Even your void is powerless before my flames!
There's that remarkable power and speed I remember! You really haven't changed, Jotaro!
Let's meet again someday, Jotaro from 10 years in the future...
I don't know how this is happening, but that man is clearly Jotaro!
I take back what I said... You're as strong as you've ever been.
Well fought! I suppose I should have foreseen this.
I knew it was you, Mr Joestar. You can't fool Avdol!
Your Star Platinum may be strong, but you must never let your guard down.
You possess not only power, but amazing precision!
Tch, tch, tch! You didn't stand a chance!
Did you forget, Kakyoin? My Stand is called Magician's Red precisely because it can manipulate flames as it pleases!
Those calm calculations... That's the Kakyoin I know.
Hm? Did you say something, Kakyoin?
You thought you could defeat us?
Gah hah hah hah! Wah hah hah!
Hm... Seems that way.
Mr Joestar, are you okay?
Now THIS is the perfect role for my character!
Heh heh! I'm a fortuneteller, remember?
Well done, Iggy! Here's some gum.
You're a reliable ally, as long as you decide to help out.
Mr Joestar... I was talking to YOU.
Oh, please excuse me. I thought for sure that it was some kind of costume.
I see your age has had no effect on your power, Jotaro.
Ten years have passed? Time sure flies...
Don't get too riled up now, Jotaro.
Your mind is still just as strong as it was back then.
Your mind is still just as strong as it was back then.
The enemy knows exactly how you work!
You may have lived your entire life on your own, but you won't be able to win this alone!
She can't hear you, Mr Joestar. I believe she's unconscious.
Yes, indeed. After all that running around, I could use a bite to eat.
Iggy! Use that nose of yours! That was a very dangerous enemy we just faced!
Is he DIO's trump card? Iggy... I would have been his prey if it weren't for you.
Did you listen to a word I said?! I told you NOT to help me!
Sorry. I couldn't help it...
My Magician's Red will vaporize you in a flash!
That went well. You followed my plan to a T, Mr Joestar!
Burn into cinders and begone!
There won't even be a trace of you left. You will burn to ash and vanish from the world!
Let's do this together!
Please help!
Here I come!
Here I come!
Here I come!
Allow me to help!
Full power!
Yes sir!
Yes sir!
Feel the heat of my flames!
I'll create a diversion!
Surprising.
Good work!
Your efforts were not in vain!
Whaaat?! Jotaro!
Jean Pierre!!
It can't be! Mr Joestar!
Iggy... Your efforts were not in vain!!
Allow me to help!
Pffft... Ooh hee hee hee...
Pffft... Ooh hee hee hee...
Grrr... Woooof!!
Then, Iggy had a thought! "That enemy is coming at me!"
I've gotta get them before they get me!
I've never wasted a single thought on you...
This has nothing to do with me.
Outta the way, you stupid mutt!
Well, look who's coming for an ass-whooping! Good luck, moron.
Think you're something, huh tough guy?! Bring it on!
We're on equal ground? No, I'm the stronger one!
What's with those bangs?! Get out the hair clippers, jerk!
Just give me the coffee gum!
What are you supposed to be, French or something?!
I'm gonna tear out your hair and fart in your face!
Still sore about what happened back in New York?
I'm gonna beat this guy and steal all his coffee gum!
How dare you drag me to a place like this! Don't you know what I'll do to ya?!
Are you the one who called me out here, Joestar?!
DIO... So YOU'RE the one behind this!
Time to pay you back for what your little birdie did to me...
Shuddup already... I'm trying to take my afternoon nap!
You probably think you're hidden, but I can smell you from a mile away, dumbass!
Bring it on, birdbrain! I'm gonna chomp you to bits!
Those eyes... I can never tell what birds are thinking...
C-Come at me if you dare! I'll chew you like a toy!
Wh-what's with this guy!?
This is Jotaro's scent! I'm sure of it!
Did Jotaro change his hat? Hee hee! I'm gonna stick another piece of gum on it!
I don't know you! Don't call me like you know me or something!
Huuuuh? Are you...Jotaro?
That's my line! Just don't get in my way, human!
This guy... I know his scent from somewhere...
Don't you dare order me around!
(sniff)
Like I'd ever listen to you! I only do what I wanna do!
You think I'd let a moron like YOU control me?!
You should get behind me!
Tch! You think I'd ever wanna fight with a loser like you?!
Shut your mouth and stop ordering me around!
Why would I ever listen to you?!
I'm only gonna do what I want! Period!
You want me to rip your hair out too, old man?!
Grr... I'm not your pet, okay?!
Whoa, whoa, what gives? Why am I teamed up with that stupid bird?!
Let's try to get along now...okay?
What the hell...?
What a weird outfit... It's gonna come in handy somehow, right?
Tch! Get me outta here!
I don't know who you are, but you don't get to order me around!
Jotaro... Are you half-asleep or something?
Seems like you've really gotten old since we last met... Don't get in my way, okay?!
An enemy?! But I never smelled him!
(panting)
Don't panic! Calm down! I've got a plan!
Where's he gonna come from next?! I can't smell him!
Damn you! Why'd you have to get me wrapped up in such a mess!
This isn't funny! I'm allergic to trouble!
Grrrrr...
Gwararararf!
Hmph... No one orders ME around!
This has got nothing to do with me! So long!
Know your place, ya dumb mutt!
You're barking up the wrong tree!
I'm gonna put some more gum on your hat! Hee hee hee!
Yeaaah! I win! Heh heh heh!
I'm gonna spit some gum on those stupid bangs!
Just hurry up and give me my gum already!
Gotta hand it to ya, you're not half bad!
All right! Time to tear some hair!
That's for that time in New York.
Okay! Now give me all the coffee gum you've got!
I'm not a goddamn toy for you humans!
Heh! Now I get to do what I want!
Now we know who the REAL emperor is!
That's what you get for siccing that damn bird on me!
Tch! I'm never gonna get back to sleep now...
Now that I've gotten a closer look... Your hair looks like it'd be really fun to rip out! Hee hee hee!
You're dead meat, birdbrain... Serves ya right!
I've never been interested in you or your master DIO... Let's just call this a draw.
What void? The only void I see is the one inside your skull, doofus!
You had me scared for a second there... But you're not so tough, chump!
What the? Why have you gotten older?
Now I'm gonna yank off that dumb hat and rip all your hair out!
This scent... Could this be Jotaro?
It's been a while, but I don't have time to play around with you!
Just call me Master Iggy!
Is this Joseph Joestar? But then why does he seem different somehow?
Hmph! I only fought because I felt like it!
Hee hee!
Tch! I wasn't fighting for your sake!
No one's ever tamed me! And no one ever will!
Tch! Ignorance is bliss.
I crushed my enemy! Now it's your turn! Heh heh!
Whenever I see your hair, I get really excited...
Just hurry up and give me the gum! You can't hide it from my nose!
Tch! Ignorance is bliss.
Whew. That felt good...
Stop being so stingy and give me the whole box, geezer!
Hey, birdbrain... Why are you staring at me? Don't get any weird ideas... I'm not your prey!
Can I consider him my ally? For now, at least...?
You smell the same as Joseph Joestar... Is it just my imagination?
You think I'm gonna take you seriously in that costume?! Just hurry up and give me the gum!
What makes you think you can order me around?!
How do you know my favorite snack? Just who are you?
Tch! How could you forget?! I don't want one, I want the whole box!
You only won 'cuz of me! I want some thanks!
Are those flames just for show? I thought they detect stuff!
I don't want your thanks! Just gimme some gum! Hmph!
Yeah! I tricked him!! The fake DIO I created with The Fool made him drop his guard!
(GRIN) Swallow The Fool's sand and get lost!
I picked up your hat. Hurry up and put it on... Hee hee!
Watch that ego there, pal! You better not be thinking you're stronger than ME!
Grrrr! Grrrrr!
Awoooooooooooo!
Woof woof!
Howwwwl!
Woof!
Woo!
Hoooowl!
Grahh!
Hmph!
Grrr!
Now I have to finish your job as well? Grrr!
You got too carried away, dummy!
Woof!
Well, look at that! A head not even a mother could love!
Hermit Purple!
Eat this!
Kaaaaaaaa!!
Overdrive!!
Way to fly!
OH NOOOOOO!
You're still green.
Don't underestimate my Hermit Purple!
Ready to see my Stand? Here it comes!!
Watch it, now!
Tch!
Wh-what?!
Call me crazy, but this dashing actor-type looks an awful lot like me!
Hmm. I feel like I've seen you somewhere before...
He's young, but he definitely knows how to fight.
Step aside unless you wanna get hurt, kid!
Y-You're... Speedwagon?!
This boy... Could it be? Could he be me when I was younger?
Just who is this senseless fool?
Caesar! Is that you, Caesar?!
That face really brings back memories...
My mother's younger than me... What a weird feeling.
Lisa Lisa! How about a Hamon training session for old times' sake?
That face... You're Stroheim!
Stroheim! I heard that you died in the Battle of Stalingrad...
I never thought I'd have to fight you again!
Wamuu! Why are you alive?!
I'd never forget the payback I owe you, Kars...
OH MY GOD! No way! What is he doing here?!
You're really sharp, Esidisi... You sensed the Stand energy coming out from my body, didn't you?
It's been a while since someone called me that...
You wanna try me on for size? Don't expect any mercy, Jotaro!
Just come back with me.
I'll take you on from any angle!
I'm ready when you are!
"Is my left hand a right?" What a strange question... Why would he ask that?
I can still take you youngsters on!
Here I come, Avdol! Hit me with everything you've got!
Bring it on. You don't need to hold back.
What's gotten into you? Why are you so angry?
Calm down, Iggy. What's the matter?
DIO!
Kakyoin's not one to fool around at a time like this... Why would he go that way?
Hm? I haven't the foggiest who you might be talking about...
Avdol and Kakyoin had to team up to defeat this Stand... I need to stay vigilant!
She's a clever one. I may have already fallen into some kind of trap...
Well isn't that nice. Stop trying to hurt me, then!
If you're not just the spitting image of Jotaro...
Hmmm. Is this what Japanese delinquents look like?
Well, that is my name, but...have we met somewhere before?
Japanese children are so short!
Is your manga really that popular? I don't think it's been translated into English yet...
Hm? Do you have a Stand too?
A high schooler, huh... He looks about as old as Jotaro and Kakyoin, too.
Huh? Stamp loser?
Step aside, my dear, or else you'll get hurt!
Calm down! I'm not trying to start anything with you!
So you're a Stand user as well...
Is that your Stand?
A Stand?! But I thought you were just a normal corporate stiff!
I know that you're secretly planning to kill me... You can't fool these old eyes!
You must be one of DIO's assassins!
Huh? Poppo Poppo Hatopoppo?
DIO had a son?!
My wallet... It's missing all of a sudden!
Hmm, this girl... She reminds me of someone.
You have a tattoo? What a wild girl!
OH NO! OH MY GOD! I completely forgot about that disguise!
Get out of that awful disguise right this instant!
I must be going senile... I'm seeing an adult Jotaro standing in front of me.
Looks like the years have calmed you down a bit!
I knew I recognized that face... Jotaro?!
Jotaro... You've really grown.
You've become an even dandier old gentleman than me!
No need to worry, young man!
Don't hold me back now, you thug!
I feel like I've seen him somewhere before...
You can tell? You're so sharp, Joseph Joestar!
Whoa, it's the young me!
Never thought I'd get to fight alongside you again...
Who do you think I am? Leave this to me!
Lisa Lisa! Let me fight with you!
Just watch me fight, and that should clear up your doubts!
I don't need you to worry about me! Let's go!
It'll take the both of us to win this one, Jotaro!
Jotaro, do you understand my battle philosophy now?
Don't do anything rash, Kakyoin!
You must be pretty confident if you've got the time to worry about others, Kakyoin.
Looks like this is a job for us, Kakyoin!
Don't just charge in without a plan, Jean Pierre!
Jean Pierre! Follow me, and keep your guard up!
I'm not that old yet!
Go right ahead.
Enemy incoming!
All ready, Avdol?
Hey, Iggy, if you want to rip out some hair, go for theirs! Torment the enemy!
Iggy! Enemies first, gum later!
Time to show you how important battle experience really is!
We can't lose this battle!
I wish I could have shown you how strong I was when I was a little younger.
Ready to bash some brains in, knucklehead?!
Think carefully as you fight!
Here, Koichi, let me teach you how to really fight.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Rohan, was it? Let's show them how it's done!
If youngsters I don't even know are telling me that now, I must be pretty darn amazing!
You're his son...? You've inherited a bizarre fate, Giorno.
What, you're going to treat me like an old geezer now?
Allow me to lend a hand, young lady!
Guess it was worth living this long! Can't believe I got to meet Jotaro's daughter!
I know this was my doing, but still...
Look at that outfit! Ee hee hee!!
Ten years from now...I wonder if I'll still be alive...
The years have been kind to you, Jotaro.
That's my line, Jotaro!
Can you still fight, Jotaro? Looks like you've really gotten up in your years...
Can you still fight, Jotaro? Looks like you've really gotten up in your years...
She's a clever one. I may have already fallen into some kind of trap...
Hermit Purple!
What's going on here...?
I got it, Avdol! You're going to throw your bracelets and draw him out with the sound, right?!
Don't do anything rash, Kakyoin!
DIO!
Don't worry, Josuke! Just leave this to me!
Hey! They're the same age as you!
I'm coming straight at you. You won't have space to breathe!
Damned fool!
I really don't like you...
What's going on...? "Surreal" isn't the half of it!
It appears you still have much to learn about the Joseph Joestar Way!
This feeling... Could that be my grandfather?
You don't have a Stand, but that Hamon is incredible... And it feels like it'll only get stronger!
Have I seen this thug somewhere before, or is it just me?
But you passed away over 30 years ago! What are you doing alive?!
You know, I gotta admit: you're pretty handsome. Still not as good as me, though!
Youngsters these days are just pathetic. I was way tougher when I was your age, you know...
Is that you, Caesar? Is that really you?
Caesar! It's about time you stopped treating everyone like a hick!
Can't you be a little nicer to your son?
This really brings back memories of all your severe training...
You know, I always wanted to have you make this fake hand of mine a little more convenient...
Heh! Arrogant as ever, I see!
Return to the wind, like you did 50 years ago!
Return to your eternal slumber, friend...
That was for my left arm!
I couldn't be more shocked if a meteor fell in front of me! What are you doing here?!
Hmph! That was nothing compared to Avdol's flames!
You may think you're above me, but I'm so high you'll never touch me!
I know exactly how you think, grandson!
Jotaro's even more powerful than I anticipated!
Heh heh heh! Not like you at all, Kakyoin!
I haven't sweat this much in a while.
I earned this scar on my left arm in a fight about 50 years back...
"The older, the wiser!" Hmm, I must really sound like an old fart now...
It's getting warm in here... Mind turning that Stand of yours down a bit?
I should have known better than to get this desperate at my age... You OK, Avdol?
I guess it IS important to try to understand how animals feel... Ew, is this drool?
Maybe it was a mistake to call you here...
What's the matter? Didn't you say something about sucking me dry?
Everyone's got a bone to pick with you. Over the past 100 years, you've earned yourself payback from a ton of people!
Wrinkles aren't the only thing I've gained over the years!
That was some pretty sharp water!
Pfft, pfft, pfft! My body's covered in iron sand!
You lose, my dear.
Could it be? I feel like I'm on the same wavelength with this boy, somehow.
His Stand is as strong as Star Platinum! I can't believe it!
Why does this boy know my name?
Sorry, did I hurt you? Kids like you shouldn't do dangerous things like that!
Helloooo? Who's the one with bad taste here?
People do say I look younger than my age, but...what was that all about?
He's got a terrifying Stand, but it seems like he's got some extra space up in his noggin...
Oh, Did you say Stand user? I think I've gotten a bit hard of hearing lately...
Koichi? Just what are you talking about?
I can't communicate with her at all... What a scary girl!
Josuke? Never heard of him!
Those bombs have really got a bite to 'em!
Who is this guy? He almost feels as evil as DIO himself!
I knew he was a Stand user! And he's an evil one, too!
An electric Stand user, huh?
Have I gotten hard of hearing or something?
DIO's head was attached to the body of my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar... Does that mean I'm this kid's uncle? OH MY GOD!
Wow... How could he trick me so quickly?
I knew I saw him in you! Those eyes look just like my grandson Jotaro's!
What, you've got another tattoo on your shoulder, too? Wait...this is star is...?!
This is one dangerous disguise... I can't let any of my family members find out about it!
Of course I knew it was you. Blecch! I've seen enough!
Jotaro would never get this weak... Guess I was just seeing things.
Me, cheat?! Watch your tongue! I promised to love only my wife until the day I die!
That was pathetic, Jotaro! How could a youngster like you lose to me?!
Of course I knew it was you! It doesn't matter how old you get, you'll always be my grandson!
OHH! I've still got it!
Your training is nothing compared to what I've been through!
Same goes for you, thug... Thanks for the help!
Hmm... I know I've seen you somewhere before, but where?
Of course! I know you VERY well!
What? You get to turn into this handsome actor-looking gentleman! You should be happy!
You completely ruined our reunion, you moron!!
What's wrong, Caesar? You still can't tell who I am? Geez louise...
I think there's more humor to be found in your appearance than mine, Lisa Lisa!
Don't you have anything else to say?! You know, that I look more cool and collected, or I seem sexier, or...
I know exactly what you're thinking, so it's easy to counter your moves!
Well? It was pretty hard to fight me on your own, wasn't it?
I'm not gonna let any youngsters beat me yet!
Hmm... I knew I could count on you, Kakyoin.
That kinda tired me out...
Come at us many times as you like. We can take you on anytime!
(wheeze) Can't you slow it down a bit?
They never stood a chance against us, Jean Pierre!
Heh heh heh! If you think I'm nothing but a handsome gentleman, you're gonna be in for a world of hurt!
I almost thought I was gonna catch on fire for a second there!
Avdol! Great job!
It happened just as you said it would, Avdol!
Dealing with him is such a pain...
Whoa, that was a close one! He almost got the whole box!
Josuke, did you see that? Was I awesome out there, or what?! Hee hee hee!!
Whew! Now do you understand what a cool guy I am?
A round of applause for the master trickster, Joseph Joestar!
Nice job out there, knucklehead! You fought pretty well!
I'm glad we won, but geez! You fought like a madman out there!
You have good instincts! I'm sure you can get even stronger!
I'm not sure what you were so worried about... I'm still in perfect condition!
How was that?! You know, you could put me in one of your manga if you really wanted to!
Guess my old age has made me even fiercer!
That golden spirit... You've definitely got Joestar blood flowing in your veins!
How considerate of you! Thanks a bunch!
The way you fight reminds me of...nah, maybe it's just me...
She's as powerful as her pop!
You look so stunning, you're gonna make all the women jealous!!
How could I NOT laugh?! Go and look at yourself in a mirror!
Enough, enough! Silence, Jotaro! I don't want to hear another word!
Even after 10 years, you're just as powerful as ever! That's my grandson!
You're still a little behind me in terms of experience!
You fought just like the young Jotaro! Attaboy, grandson!
You fought just like the young Jotaro! Attaboy, grandson!
You lose, my dear.
Now, let's go and get some breakfast!
Guess we managed to win somehow... Whoo.
I was trying to go easy on you, y'know! Guess we're just too strong? Sorry... Hee hee hee!
That water Stand is serious trouble... But you picked the wrong guys to mess with!
Joseph Joestar always knows exactly what you're thinking!!
So that's DIO's secret... The World can stop time!
What are you doing, Kakyoin?!
I never imagined a long-distance Stand duo could be this dangerous...
Let's go!
Don't let me down!
OK!
Leave it to me!
I'll go out first!
Over here!
Excellent!
That really did the trick!
Just leave the rest to me!
Jotaro!!
Jo...taro...
Don't...get...near him...
Your spirit will live on in mine!
Jean Pierre!!
Avdol! I'll finish this!
Iggy! Just get some rest!
Josuke... Let me be a good father to you, just this once...
I'll back you up!
Your hair's like a pile of cow dung by the side of the road!
Feast your eyes on my power.
Diiiie!
This is... The World!
Yes!
I...I can't move! I-Impossible...!
I-I can't move!
Jotaro! Damn you!
Heh.
Hmph. I suppose I could take you on.
Hoo...
Damn you!
I think life is about overcoming your fear.
To stand on top of the world is to know no fear!
So this is an encounter that crosses time itself, is it, JoJo?!
Finally...a body that befits me...
Testing my Stand against my former self... how amusing!
Hu ha ha ha... You'll be a perfect target for The World.
How brave of you to face me! Think you can bask in my presence without turning tail?
You're next, Jotaro!
This is it... the final round!
Mmmmmmm... Just as I thought, Joseph's blood suits me well... It's mixing in perfectly with this body... I might even become more powerful than I was before!
Don't make yourself sick with fear. Don't worry. Let go, Kakyoin.
You fool. Know this... the power of The World will allow me to rule over everything!
You only have one option: Die, Jean Pierre!
I figured you'd be sneaking up and attacking me from behind by now...
You've got a special power, don't you? Something normal people don't have. Show me!
Hmph! Foolish resolve will only get you killed...
So the dog is a Stand user... Well then, I suppose I can't just throw you away...
A dog?! What a joke!
Fair warning: I will suck you dry!
Joseph... You're next!
Are you really trying to shoot me?
Need something?
Don't hold back. I want you to go all-out.
Your ability is truly amazing... Mind showing me some more of it?
Come at me, Mariah. Let's see how strong you really are.
Your Stand's magnetic powers are interesting... How about lending DIO your strength?
I can feel how bloodthirsty you are... Heh heh heh. I know I'll be able to count on you, Animal Shop.
What? You want to fight DIO?!
Ice... I wish to test The World's powers. Be my guinea pig!
Ice... I want to see what Cream is truly capable of. Be my guinea pig!
Who're you...? You seem close to me...but far away as well.
Hmm... Who might you be?
If you made my The World into a DISC and stole it, you would rule the world. Just try it!
Your Pale Snake can turn souls into objects and store them... Why don't you try to do the same to me, then?
You're that magician... I thought you were dead and rotting!
A Hamon user? You probably won't even be enough to warm up The World, but so be it!
Sorry, but I couldn't possibly remember the names of all you little maggots.
I know you. You're that little worm who was always stuck to JoJo's side...
That face... You're a Joestar!
Joseph? Did you put on the Stone Mask?
I summoned no such opponent here!
...What mockery is this?
You're surely no match for me now, but I suppose I could play with you a bit.
Jotaro... You've certainly gotten old.
In the end, you're just another human... You're powerless against the currents of time!
Hoh... So you met Pucchi, did you? Interesting...
You and I were always one and the same...
JoJo... I never thought I'd get to stand here with you again...
Who dares to challenge DIO and Dio?!
I, DIO, will conquer the entire world!
Don't let me down now, Hol Horse.
I'm still not completely ready to fight yet... I'm counting on you.
Kill them, Hol Horse, just like you always do...
I know you can win this.
No, I'll go out too. I've been in need of some exercise.
Can I leave this to you, Ice?
It's been a while since I've seen what your Stand can do. Show me.
Would you like to take this one, N'doul?
Allow me to be your eyes this time.
Mariah... Show them how amusing your Stand can be.
Heh heh heh... It makes you that happy?
Do whatever you like.
Do your worst, Animal Shop!
This is the gatekeeper to my mansion, Animal Shop!
If anyone comes near my mansion... I trust you know what to do.
Lend me your strength, Giorno.
Don't you dare embarrass DIO out there, Giorno!
Why should a father have to interfere with his son's battle, Giorno?
The true victors are those who have seen Heaven...
Will you betray me someday?
You're the definition of a true friend.
Hmph! It's futile!
I only see Kakyoin and Joseph in front of me... They must have split into two groups in order to try and surround me.
You split into two groups to try and surround me, didn't you? Which means Jotaro and Jean Pierre must be creeping up on me from behind right now...
Know this... The power of The World will allow me to rule over everything!
Some destinies deserve to be destroyed! Some fates deserve to be vanquished!
Heh heh. I expect great things from you, my son...
I never would have thought you'd give birth to a daughter, Jotaro...
Will you fight for me now, Giorno?
That brat... Hmph! So be it.
Without further ado, it's time for the final strike! This is the absolute final time freeze!
Tsk!
Maggot!!
Now I've proven that nobody can surpass DIO!
Heh heh heh...! I have conquered even the terror that is myself!
My friend... This body will continue to serve me into the future!
JoJo was a part of my youth! And now I've buried that youth forever!
Vaporizing Freeze... Ahh, what memories!
Invincible...immortal...STAND POWER!!
Star Platinum has finally perished in the face of The World!
Now I can finally cut off the Joestar bloodline!
Fate led these nemeses to me... But now I bid you adieu!
To be honest, I'm glad I was able to kill you quickly, Jotaro.
There is nothing to be afraid of. Let us band together!
You haven't even noticed that you're dead. No way you would ever realize it...
Once I kill you, I suppose that'll be the end of the Joestar Egyptian Tour, eh?
No one can assassinate DIO...
I want you to use your Stand for my own ends. Lend me your powers... Ha ha ha!
Couldn't foresee your own fate, could you fortuneteller?
What to do now? Perhaps I'll kill some time by turning you into a zombie!
You sure wasted a lot of my time... Now to chop you up and feed you to my bird!
Hamon gave me trouble before, but it's no match for The World!
Joseph! Grandson of Jonathan! I've killed you at last!
I like you. You never sweated, never lost your rhythm. You are cool as ice, Hol Horse.
Make sure you actually kill the Joestars this time...for my sake. Otherwise I'll just kill you!
N'doul... There's no need for you to die. Take my blood and come back to life...
I'm going to use that power of yours to help me defeat the Joestars, N'doul.
The magnetism is wearing off... What's wrong? Finished already?
Just stay by my side, and you'll have nothing to fear.
What was that, Animal Shop? Is squawking the only thing you're good at?
You'll attack anyone... That's why I knew you were fit to be my gatekeeper.
There's no need for you to die... Take my blood and be reborn...
Ice. Would you give me some of your blood?
You... I like you.
Giorno Giovanna? Hmph! Never heard of you!
I never thought I'd meet a man who would calm me like this. I was scared to see you go...
You'll become a very noble clergyman.
Unfortunately for you, Zeppeli, you were fated to die either way.
Even before I got a Stand, I knew your Hamon was nothing to fear!
Speed...wagon? Huh?
You're, what was it again... Ah yes...Speedwagon!
His aura reminds me of Jonathan's...
Young blood fits this body so perfectly! Hu ha ha ha!
Were you trying to throw me off guard with that peculiar outfit? What a stupid battle.
Even though you're a Joestar, for some reason I don't feel like drinking your blood...
Heh heh heh! What's wrong, Jotaro? Has Star Platinum gotten slower?
Hmph... Those dull movements of yours already look like they're frozen in time!
Now the Joestar bloodline is finished!
Rejoice, dear friend! I just destroyed the last of the Joestars!
If there truly exists a god that controls our fate, then having us meet up was one of his best plans yet!
Your body has served me very well, JoJo.
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!
The true ruler of this world is...
Hmph... You finally won a battle for me.
My body still isn't in top condition yet, but this should do.
You did a fine job, Hol Horse.
Heh heh heh... Your Stand truly is invincible!
Cool Ice... Because of you, I was hardly able to get in any exercise out there.
I feel the most comfortable when I'm standing next to you, Cool Ice.
Heh heh... Excellent work, N'doul! Your Stand is a powerful one!
That wasn't even enough to warm me up.
You're the finest marksman I know, N'doul.
Your magnetism is getting stronger... Good job, Mariah.
That was a waste of time... Let's go, Mariah.
Are you satisfied now, Mariah?
Heh... Satisfied?
Did you underestimate him because he's a bird? What a fool...
Very good. I'll give you as many treats as you like.
That's it. Use your power to satisfy your desires. Heh heh heh...
Heh... I knew you had it in you, son.
You fought well out there, Giorno!
I aim to make it there no matter what I have to sacrifice!
Sorry... I didn't mean to insult you.
I'm sure you have what it takes to make it to Heaven!
You haven't even noticed that you're dead. No way you would ever realize it...
Hmph! It's futile!
Fate led these nemeses to me... But now I bid you adieu!
I, DIO, have far surpassed all the Stand users and creatures who inhabit our world!
You're nothing but puny humans whose lives only last for the blink of an eye!
MUDA MUDA MUDAAA!
Now no one can prevent me from reaching Heaven!
I'll do whatever it takes to win and conquer! This is all you need to remember, my son...
Giorno... I wish I didn't have to kill you, but so be it.
Let's go!
Assist me!
Let's do this, friend.
Very good.
WRYYYYY!
Okay!
Over here!
Pay attention!
Excellent!
Not bad, I guess.
Your power is mine now!
You did a fine job out there.
You let your guard down, Ice...
Fine... I'll handle the rest.
Don't disappoint me like this...
Perhaps I put too much trust in you?
Giorno... Is that the extent of your power?
The road to Heaven is a long one...
The road to Heaven is a long one...
Hmph!
WRYYYYYYYYYY!
You! You saw me!
Well done.
I'm satisfied enough. Now there's no need to play with you toys anymore!
Foolish human! I will rule over you! Bow before my might and intelligence!
That's all?
I think I like you.
Heh heh heh heh. I'll give you one chance.
What's wrong? You're trembling.
You'll just have to die.
Relax. No need to be scared sick.
Fair warning: I will suck you dry!
A trickster, are you?
Heh... I'll give you some credit.
Too slow!
Let me test you out a little more...
Time to end this, now.
I'm asking you! Can you see it or not?!
Can you see it or not?
MUDAMUDA!
Your hair's like a pile of cow dung by the side of the road!
The World Over Heaven!
Reality...bend to my will!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
This is REALITY!
Heh.
Hmph. I suppose I could take you on.
Hoo...
Damn you!
I think life is about overcoming your fear.
To stand on top of the world is to know no fear!
So this is an encounter that crosses time itself, is it, JoJo?!
Finally...a body that befits me...
Testing my Stand against my former self... how amusing!
Hu ha ha ha... You'll be a perfect target for The World.
How brave of you to face me! Think you can bask in my presence without turning tail?
You're next, Jotaro!
This is it... the final round!
Mmmmmmm... Just as I thought, Joseph's blood suits me well... It's mixing in perfectly with this body... I might even become more powerful than I was before!
Don't make yourself sick with fear. Don't worry. Let go, Kakyoin.
You fool. Know this... the power of The World will allow me to rule over everything!
You only have one option: Die, Jean Pierre!
I figured you'd be sneaking up and attacking me from behind by now...
You've got a special power, don't you? Something normal people don't have. Show me!
Hmph! Foolish resolve will only get you killed...
So the dog is a Stand user... Well then, I suppose I can't just throw you away...
A dog?! What a joke!
Fair warning: I will suck you dry!
Joseph... You're next!
Are you really trying to shoot me?
Need something?
Don't hold back. I want you to go all-out.
Your ability is truly amazing... Mind showing me some more of it?
Come at me, Mariah. Let's see how strong you really are.
Your Stand's magnetic powers are interesting... How about lending DIO your strength?
I can feel how bloodthirsty you are... Heh heh heh. I know I'll be able to count on you, Animal Shop.
What? You want to fight DIO?!
Ice... I wish to test The World's powers. Be my guinea pig!
Ice... I want to see what Cream is truly capable of. Be my guinea pig!
Who're you...? You seem close to me...but far away as well.
Hmm... Who might you be?
If you made my The World into a DISC and stole it, you would rule the world. Just try it!
Your Pale Snake can turn souls into objects and store them... Why don't you try to do the same to me, then?
You're that magician... I thought you were dead and rotting!
A Hamon user? You probably won't even be enough to warm up The World, but so be it!
Sorry, but I couldn't possibly remember the names of all you little maggots.
I know you. You're that little worm who was always stuck to JoJo's side...
That face... You're a Joestar!
Joseph? Did you put on the Stone Mask?
...What mockery is this?
I summoned no such opponent here!
You're surely no match for me now, but I suppose I could play with you a bit.
Jotaro... You've certainly gotten old.
In the end, you're just another human... You're powerless against the currents of time!
Hoh... So you met Pucchi, did you? Interesting...
You and I were always one and the same...
JoJo... I never thought I'd get to stand here with you again...
Who dares to challenge DIO and Dio?!
I, DIO, will conquer the entire world!
Don't let me down now, Hol Horse.
I'm still not completely ready to fight yet... I'm counting on you.
Kill them, Hol Horse, just like you always do...
I know you can win this.
No, I'll go out too. I've been in need of some exercise.
Can I leave this to you, Ice?
It's been a while since I've seen what your Stand can do. Show me.
Would you like to take this one, N'doul?
Allow me to be your eyes this time.
Mariah... Show them how amusing your Stand can be.
Heh heh heh... It makes you that happy?
Do whatever you like.
Do your worst, Animal Shop!
This is the gatekeeper to my mansion, Animal Shop!
If anyone comes near my mansion... I trust you know what to do.
Lend me your strength, Giorno.
Don't you dare embarrass DIO out there, Giorno!
Why should a father have to interfere with his son's battle, Giorno?
The true victors are those who have seen Heaven...
Will you betray me someday?
You're the definition of a true friend.
Hmph! It's futile!
I only see Kakyoin and Joseph in front of me... They must have split into two groups in order to try and surround me.
You split into two groups to try and surround me, didn't you? Which means Jotaro and Jean Pierre must be creeping up on me from behind right now...
Know this... The power of The World will allow me to rule over everything!
Some destinies deserve to be destroyed! Some fates deserve to be vanquished!
Heh heh. I expect great things from you, my son...
I never would have thought you'd give birth to a daughter, Jotaro...
Will you fight for me now, Giorno?
That brat... Hmph! So be it.
Fight me, Jotaro.
This is it! The final round!!
Oh, what rapture! Soon I'll be able to stop time for one, ten, even 60 minutes...
I, DIO, have far surpassed all the Stand users and creatures who inhabit our world! And now I can stop time for a whole 5 seconds!
Hmph! You're mine! If we were playing chess or shogi right now, you'd be in CHECKMATE!
Invincible...immortal...STAND POWER!!
I, DIO, possess none of that! All I have is one simple principle... Just one! Win, and seize control! That's it! That alone is my satisfaction!
Tsk!
Maggot!!
I must eliminate Jonathan's bloodline forever...
I offer you a proposal: why not become my partner?
Just to make this clear, I'm not afraid of the Joestars, I just know that their bloodline is not to be underestimated!
My left side is weak... This body still isn't fully used to me.
Got to match the right blood with the right body... Look, it's mixing in perfectly!
Go down two steps. I'll let you join me again. But if you want to die... step upward.
You could serve me forever, hm? I can offer you an eternal security.
This is The World. Not that you can see or feel it. Time has stopped for you.
Seeing as how this is Jonathan's body, wouldn't you agree that Joestar blood would be the perfect match for it?
You're finished...
Automobiles are convenient until everyone has one, jamming the roads. But when time stops, only one can move... DIO, and DIO alone!
To be honest, I'm glad I was able to kill you quickly, Jotaro.
No one can assassinate DIO...
Now to squeeze out the last drops! Heh heh heh heh!
I still feel the power...
Oh, this feels goo-oo-ood!
You want to live out your life the right way? You want to live an honest life without any regrets? The way you think is as stupid as rat shit smeared all over a toilet, and now it's going to be the death of you!
The process... The method... You think I care about that!?
Now I've proven that nobody can surpass DIO!
Heh heh heh...! I have conquered even the terror that is myself!
My friend... This body will continue to serve me into the future!
JoJo was a part of my youth! And now I've buried that youth forever!
Vaporizing Freeze... Ahh, what memories!
Invincible...immortal...STAND POWER!!
Star Platinum has finally perished in the face of The World!
Now I can finally cut off the Joestar bloodline!
Fate led these nemeses to me... But now I bid you adieu!
To be honest, I'm glad I was able to kill you quickly, Jotaro.
There is nothing to be afraid of. Let us band together!
You haven't even noticed that you're dead. No way you would ever realize it...
Once I kill you, I suppose that'll be the end of the Joestar Egyptian Tour, eh?
No one can assassinate DIO...
I want you to use your Stand for my own ends. Lend me your powers... Ha ha ha!
Couldn't foresee your own fate, could you fortuneteller?
What to do now? Perhaps I'll kill some time by turning you into a zombie!
You sure wasted a lot of my time... Now to chop you up and feed you to my bird!
Hamon gave me trouble before, but it's no match for The World!
Joseph! Grandson of Jonathan! I've killed you at last!
I like you. You never sweated, never lost your rhythm. You are cool as ice, Hol Horse.
Make sure you actually kill the Joestars this time...for my sake. Otherwise I'll just kill you!
N'doul... There's no need for you to die. Take my blood and come back to life...
I'm going to use that power of yours to help me defeat the Joestars, N'doul.
The magnetism is wearing off... What's wrong? Finished already?
Just stay by my side, and you'll have nothing to fear.
What was that, Animal Shop? Is squawking the only thing you're good at?
You'll attack anyone... That's why I knew you were fit to be my gatekeeper.
There's no need for you to die... Take my blood and be reborn...
Ice. Would you give me some of your blood?
You... I like you.
Giorno Giovanna? Hmph! Never heard of you!
I never thought I'd meet a man who would calm me like this. I was scared to see you go...
You'll become a very noble clergyman.
Unfortunately for you, Zeppeli, you were fated to die either way.
Even before I got a Stand, I knew your Hamon was nothing to fear!
Speed...wagon? Huh?
You're, what was it again... Ah yes...Speedwagon!
His aura reminds me of Jonathan's...
Young blood fits this body so perfectly! Hu ha ha ha!
Even though you're a Joestar, for some reason I don't feel like drinking your blood...
Were you trying to throw me off guard with that peculiar outfit? What a stupid battle.
Heh heh heh! What's wrong, Jotaro? Has Star Platinum gotten slower?
Hmph... Those dull movements of yours already look like they're frozen in time!
Now the Joestar bloodline is finished!
Rejoice, dear friend! I just destroyed the last of the Joestars!
If there truly exists a god that controls our fate, then having us meet up was one of his best plans yet!
Your body has served me very well, JoJo.
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!
The true ruler of this world is...
Hmph... You finally won a battle for me.
My body still isn't in top condition yet, but this should do.
You did a fine job, Hol Horse.
Heh heh heh... Your Stand truly is invincible!
Cool Ice... Because of you, I was hardly able to get in any exercise out there.
I feel the most comfortable when I'm standing next to you, Cool Ice.
Heh heh... Excellent work, N'doul! Your Stand is a powerful one!
That wasn't even enough to warm me up.
You're the finest marksman I know, N'doul.
Your magnetism is getting stronger... Good job, Mariah.
That was a waste of time... Let's go, Mariah.
Are you satisfied now, Mariah?
Heh... Satisfied?
Did you underestimate him because he's a bird? What a fool...
Very good. I'll give you as many treats as you like.
That's it. Use your power to satisfy your desires. Heh heh heh...
Heh... I knew you had it in you, son.
You fought well out there, Giorno!
I aim to make it there no matter what I have to sacrifice!
Sorry... I didn't mean to insult you.
I'm sure you have what it takes to make it to Heaven!
You haven't even noticed that you're dead. No way you would ever realize it...
Hmph! It's futile!
Fate led these nemeses to me... But now I bid you adieu!
I, DIO, have far surpassed all the Stand users and creatures who inhabit our world!
You're nothing but puny humans whose lives only last for the blink of an eye!
MUDA MUDA MUDAAA!
Now no one can prevent me from reaching Heaven!
I'll do whatever it takes to win and conquer! This is all you need to remember, my son...
Giorno... I wish I didn't have to kill you, but so be it.
Kneel before my reality!
No one can destroy the reality that I, DIO have created...
Let's go!
Assist me!
Hmph!
WRYYYYY!
Over here!
Pay attention!
Excellent!
Not bad, I guess.
You did a fine job out there.
You let your guard down, Ice...
Fine... I'll handle the rest.
Don't disappoint me like this...
Perhaps I put too much trust in you?
Giorno... Is that the extent of your power?
The road to Heaven is a long one...
The road to Heaven is a long one...
Let's go!
Hmph!
This is the path to Heaven!
You dare to resist reality? MUDA MUDA!
Just die already!
I still need more energy!
Time's up!
Fight your own family...
I've overwritten your daughter!
I need to buy more time...
More... Just a little more!
Heh heh heh. The time has come!
I can lend you a hat if you wanna cover that disaster up!
Emperor!
I'm inside the mirror...
Fire...
Aye aye, sir!
We're the unbeatable duo!
It's over.
You know how I work by now. Right, Centerfold?
Ready? When your Hanged Man and my Emperor team up, no one stands a chance!
Let's be friends, huh?
Tch!
Let's see who's quicker on the draw!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Just let me give you a hug. That'll be enough to please me!
If you've got some time to kill, then let ol' Hol Horse entertain you!
Kakyoin the Hierophant user, huh? Death to the betrayer!
Hierophant's a long-distance Stand, isn't it? I happen to know someone with a verrry similar ability...
The gun is mightier than the sword! Mmm! Such a genius quote!
Hol Horse! That's my name... And my Stand represents the Emperor card!
I'll put a hole right between your eyes, Avdol!
This is the last nuisance I needed right now...
The Emperor's forte is close-quarters assassination! We got 'em now!
I'm gonna blow your brains all over the floor, Mr. DIO!
I know you love Lord DIO and all, but how about giving me a little worship too?
I never get tired of seeing those legs!
Whoa there, little lady... What are you in such a hurry for?
That black hair looks positively beautiful, baby.
Let's see who's quicker on the draw!
Can your Stand control bullets too?
Mind telling me your name, pretty girl?
Hold on a minute! That's not what I came here for!
Well would you look at those eyes... Absolutely charming!
You've got some killer fashion sense!
Now you're talking, baby! I love wild women like you!
Hey babe, come here often?
I never thought I'd get to partner up with Lord DIO!
Please leave this to me, Lord DIO!
Consider it done!
This is the last nuisance I needed right now...
Even my bullets are part of my Stand!
C'mon, Jean-Jean!
I guess death is pretty anticlimactic most of the time, huh?
Let's take these guys out and reap the rewards, Mr Centerfold!
You're next on my hit list!
What a selfish prick...
Guns are stronger than guns—wait, how did that go?
Too slow! That draw was enough to make me yawn!
Bye bye. Hol Horse loves ya!
Seeing a beauty like you and not saying anything would just be downright rude!
Most betrayals end up with tragic consequences, you know. It may sound arrogant, but a fact's a fact!
See? I knew you were no match for us!
You signed your own death warrant the moment you underestimated me!
You took me for a fool, Jean Pierre, and you lost!
Looks like you just lost your most dangerous pawn!
Me and Centerfold's weapons were weak against Avdol... And now he's gone! Bless you, Lady Luck!
I stick by the strongest I find. That's it! I never swore loyalty to the likes of you! I never sold my soul!
Well, that was easy! The treasure's all mine now!
DIO's just a TINY bit stronger than me, you know!
I sure do love a girl with a sharp tongue like yours, baby!
A young girl's innocent love... So cute!
Love Extra? What a wonderful name for a Stand...
Even my bullets are part of my Stand!
Your bullets are nothing to write home about!
Trish... What a beautiful name...
I don't know the details, but relax. I'm always kind to women...
I like tough girls too, y'know.
You just don't quit, baby!
Smack, you said? I'll give you a Smack whenever you want, baby!
I just love it when you talk smack to me...
Hee hee... How was that? I did it, Lord DIO!
That was DIO's Stand just now... The World! And he says he's not ready for battle? Yeah right!
That was DIO's Stand just now... The World! And he says he's not ready for battle? Yeah right!
Hee hee! I'm honored to hear that, sir...
I guess death is pretty anticlimactic most of the time, huh?
Looks like you just lost your most dangerous pawn!
If you're gonna run, then you'd better run like mad!
Dying before getting to say goodbye is the lay of the land, amigo.
When Mr Centerfold's Hanged Man and my Emperor team up, no one stands a chance!
Back me up!
Don't let me down!
This our chance!
Giddy-up!
Okay!
Yes sir!
Finish him off for me!
I'll start this off!
That's why you're my partner!
I knew I picked the right partner!
We can't run from this!
Lord DIO... Nooo!
Giddy-up!
Is something riding on top of his head?
I know exactly where you are!
Now to finish you! Shoot him!
Heh heh heh... It's completely silent now.
You noticed N'doul here, have you?
You noticed N'doul here, have you?
I will devote my entire soul to this and defeat you, all for the sake of Lord DIO!
Hmph...
Despicable...
Your footsteps... The way you walk... Could it be?!
That voice...is mine!
He's the first person in the world who gave me a sense of worth... I've been waiting all my life to meet someone like Lord DIO.
Judging from the distance between his steps, he's 190 or 195 cm tall... That must be Jotaro.
Judging from his steps, he's 178 cm, and weighs 65 kg... (GRIN) It's Noriaki Kakyoin.
These footsteps... They must belong to Kakyoin. Hmph! So you've come back for more, have you?
You're next, Jean Pierre!
A sword Stand? Heh! You're no match for my Geb!
So you figured it out... Heh heh heh. Not that that changes anything, though...
Your puny flames could never burn up N'doul's Stand!
Heh Heh... Rejoice, dog, for you have found the great N'doul!
Sounds like four paws... Foolish dog!
Heh heh heh... I can hear the sound of two old feet...
I'm going to take you out as well, Joseph Joestar!
As you wish, Lord DIO...
You rang, Lord DIO?
Hoh... I never expected Lord DIO would ever employ a woman as anything other than bait.
I can't hear the sounds of your Stand! Why not?!
Ice?! This is bad... This is the worst possible match-up for my Geb!
That squawking... You're Lord DIO's gatekeeper!
Is that you, Jotaro?
These footsteps... The distance between them... Heh heh heh. It's you, Jotaro!
That's Jotaro's voice... But...
Heh heh heh... Jotaro! I've found you!
Now, let's dice them up!
Lord DIO needn't soil his hands with the likes of you!
I'm not worthy, my lord! But allow me to become your sword!
Heh heh heh... Figuring it out isn't going to help you in the least... Heh heh heh!
I can hear you! I can hear you walking on your tiptoes...
You're heading toward me with that dog, Jotaro... But you'll never reach me!
Hm... This sounds like that stupid dog...
Heh heh... You're arguing. I can hear you loud and clear!
Those voices... It's Kakyoin and Jean Pierre!
Heh... I'll pick him off like a fly!
Begone...
I'll exterminate you next.
You may have been able to mimic my fighting style, but my Stand's strength is one of a kind.
We're so alike...I'd like to inspect your face... Heh heh.
My name is N'doul. My Stand represents the origin of the Tarot cards... Heh heh... You can't hear me anymore, can you?
Lord DIO... Jotaro and his Star Platinum died at the hands of N'doul!
This is what you get for betraying our noble master...
Now I've defeated you once and for all, Kakyoin!
Jotaro and his lot already defeated you once... You're nothing.
You've been fated to die ever since you betrayed Lord DIO.
These burns... That must have been Avdol. I won!
Heh heh heh... You'll need much more heat than that to vaporize my water!
I see... That dog's Stand can fly...
Heh heh heh... You really are nothing but a stupid mutt.
Hmph... You just wasted what little was left of your life.
You think you could defeat my Geb with your puny thorns?!
I don't fear death. Just as long as he doesn't abandon and murder me himself.
Lord DIO! Oh no! What have I done?!
This is all you've got? You'd probably serve Lord DIO better if you simply offered up your blood to him, Mariah...
Magnetism, eh? Now that your secret's out, you're no match for me.
I was just lucky my water didn't get frozen...
You really think you're fit to guard the mansion, Animal Shop?
It's clearly Jotaro... But his footsteps seem unusually calm for a teenager.
He wasn't as strong as I had heard, though... Did he go easy on me?
Strange... Those didn't feel like a young man's movements.
I'm glad I defeated him, but how did he anticipate my attacks?!
Enemies dispatched, Lord DIO.
You'll spend the afterlife regretting the day you defied Lord DIO!
Lord DIO... I live to serve you.
I'll drop you both at once! Shoot him! And him too!
These burns... That must have been Avdol. I won!
You really found an annoying dog to team up with, Jotaro! But you're finished now... Say goodbye!
You're done for...
Your conversation led me right to you... Shoot him!
Hierophant and Chariot have both been destroyed!
Now there is no one left to stand in our way.
Time to attack!
Time it right!
Lord DIO!
As you wish!
Very good.
Here I go!
You're mine...
I'll create an opening!
Heh... That did the trick.
Not bad.
How dare you?!
Lord DIO?! How can this be?!
As you wish!
Pfft... Did you fill that thing with iron sand or something?
No one can escape from my magnetic power!
Make yourself at home...
O-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!
No one can stop my magnetism...
Heh heh heh heh heh... Nice to meet you.
Hoo...
Haa...
Oh my! Those are some beautiful legs you've got!
Heh heh heh... I was just about to say the same to you!
Heh heh heh... Time to teach you about the horrors of magnetism!
Mohammed Avdol! So the news about you being alive was true!
Heh heh heh. Make yourself at home, Joseph Joestar.
Joseph Joestar! You're much older than me, but I did think about making a boyfriend out of you. Heh heh heh.
I'm honored to be able to spar with you like this, Lord DIO!
This man... Has he noticed my Stand, Bast?!
Are you even aware of what you're saying?
Oh right, Hol Horse... The Stand user who never manages to be of any help to Lord DIO...
I'm not like those other bloodbags!
Heh heh heh... I wonder why?
Lord DIO has a pet bird? It isn't very cute, though...
Gatekeeper? Give me a break... It's just some stupid bird!
If you wish, sir, it would be my pleasure.
I never thought I'd get to fight alongside Lord DIO!
Am I allowed to kill them too, Lord DIO?!
Heh heh heh...
You're doing your best to keep up, but I'll never let you catch me!
The magnetic force will keep getting stronger and stronger... Until it splats you like a pancake, Jotaro!
Lord DIO... I'm going to kill this one next!
Now that you touched it, you're a goner too! Heh heh heh!
Your magnetic "power" was an absolute joke.
Now that I've gotten a closer look, you actually aren't the least bit pretty. Especially now that you're covered in iron sand... Heh heh...
I need a smoke... Mind giving me a light?
O-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh! Lord DIO, I defeated Avdol!
By the way, you looked pretty handsome out there.
Forget it. You're nothing compared to the charm of Lord DIO.
I'll crush the Joestars with this power of mine!
Will you keep me by your side now, Lord DIO?
Whew... I can't believe you actually thought you could go toe-to-toe with Lord DIO!
This is why you never win your battles...
See? I'm special...
You figured out how my Stand works? So what?
Not bad... Maybe I'll give you a little treat as a reward! Heh heh heh...
This bird has a Stand?! And it's a ferocious one, too!
Finished already? Just when I got to have a little private time with Lord DIO... What a disappointment.
You're leaving already, Lord DIO?!
Heh heh heh... I've already finished the job, Lord DIO.
Unfortunately, you have to die.
You were so sure that you had cornered me that you didn't notice that I had cornered you!
You two looked pretty handsome out there.
Help me!
Here I go!
Time to finish this!
Yes!
Leave it to me.
Ah!
You little turd...
Me first!
You looked pretty handsome out there.
Not bad!
Tch! What were you thinking?!
Lord DIOOOO!
Yes!
SKREEEEEE
SKREEEEEE
Suddenly, Animal Shop detected an enemy drawing near!
Caw caw caaaaw!
Hmph...
GEH GEH GEH!
GUGAGA?!
Caw caw!
Caw caw caaaaw!
SKRAAAAAW
Suddenly, Animal Shop realized that Iggy also had a Stand!
This bird's name is Animal Shop.
Ngggggh...
Caaaaaaaw!
Ggh ggh ggh!
GUGAGAGA...
SKREEEEEE
Gyooh!
Caaaaaaw!
GEH GEH GEH!

Squawk! Squawk!

GUGAGAGA
Squawk, squawk!
SKREEEEEE

Ggggh...
GUGAGAGA, GUGAGA!

Squaaaaaaawk!
Ngggh...
Caw!
GUGA!
GUGAGA!
Gyooh!
Squawk!
Gughehhh...
Ggguhgggh...
Nngggh...
GUGA!
I must do something about that pompous hairstyle of yours!
You cannot escape it!
My mouth becomes a void...
You'll be crushed to bits!
All too easy.
I'm going to pulverize you!
This much is certain: I will find you... and I will kill you.
Lord DIO's orders are absolute!
Just don't get in my way.
My duty is to serve my one true lord, DIO!
What a nuisance you are! I'll erase you from existence!
Jean Pierre, you have the mental strength to overcome many fears and dangerous situations... But you won't overcome me.
That does it! Time to settle this once and for all, Jean Pierre!
My void will blow your puny little fire into oblivion!
Turn around, and you die.
You lowly beast! You dare defy the great DIO?! I'll have your head!
No one escapes from me...not even the tiniest mutt!
As you wish, Lord DIO.
As you wish, my lord.
Nothing can stop Cream!
Your right hand...seems peculiar.
I'll defeat them all for you... I swear it!
Lord DIO... Please stand back.
Yes, Lord DIO... I will do my best to meet your expectations.
You actually think you could defeat Lord DIO? Allow me to correct you...
Turn around, and you die.
You actually think you could defeat Lord DIO? Allow me to correct you...
Turn around, and you die.
I will corner and destroy them, no matter what... My Stand is far more powerful than theirs!
You're powerless before me...
You won't escape this time. I'll stop you no matter what it takes...
Now, Lord DIO, I merely await your order to execute them.
Now it's your turn to be swallowed up into my void...
Prepare to be obliterated, you impostor!
I alone have what it takes to be DIO's loyal servant!
Your sword is but a child's toy in the eyes of my Stand...
Jean Pierre... You didn't draw this blood. Avdol did!
What good is fire against the void!?
Kwohhh...
Now do you understand!? Well, do you!? Do you!? DO YOU!?
You brought this on yourself! You! You're the one who enraged me so! It's all your fault!
Everything I do, I do for you, Lord DIO...
DIO... I trust that I have not let you down.
You can transport whatever you chip away... It seems your ability is a bit different from my void.
Our abilities are similar, but yours is a far cry from mine!
Another life, extinguished...
Yes sir... Please accept my deepest apologies, Lord DIO.
I am deeply honored to hear that.
Avdol and Iggy were crushed into tiny pieces...and died.
One by one, my void will destroy each and every one of you.
One by one, my void will destroy each and every one of you.
They were crushed into tiny pieces...and died.
I will not die... I have no time to waste on pain.
You! You're the one who enraged me! You brought this on yourself!
Jean Pierre was crushed into tiny pieces...and died...
Now!
Let's kick it one time...
Lord DIO!
As you wish!
I'll collaborate.
Here I go!
You're wide open!!
Follow my lead!
Perhaps I underestimated them.
Hmph. Not bad.
I can handle this on my own!
You piss-ants! How dare you touch Lord DIO?!
Hmph.
Hey, great haircut... NOT.
Watch your mouth!
Shining Diamond!
If I heal you first...
If I heal you first...
DORARARARARARA...
DORA!!
...then it's totally fair!
Great!
Whoa, that scared me! Stupid turtle...
Can't we just call a truce?!
Now you've done it...
You got guts, trying to look like me! I like it!
Huh? I'm just being me...
Huh? Wait, what did you say just now?!
What the? This guy kinda...looks like me...
Hey, wait a minute. You're not... him, are you?
Ngh! You look kinda like me.
You're huge! You might be as tall as Jotaro!
Huh? Uhh, I'm...Josuke...Higashikata.
Old man Joestar? Is that really you?!
You're pretty tall, old man... I bet you're over 190 cm...
Just some practice, Koichi. Lemme show you how you use a Stand!
I'll teach you how to pull out your Stand. First, you gotta think that you either wanna protect yourself...or beat the stuffing outta someone!
Bring it on, Okuyasu. This is just practice to me!
A Stand user?! Are you really a Stand user?!
Whoa, what the hell?! Rohan Kishibe?! Talk about rotten luck!
That's it!
Now you've done it...
Please, lend me some lunch money! I forgot my change!
Well? Now what, Otoishi?
Let's throw down, punk!
Hey! No funny business!
If you can see my Shining Diamond, that means you're my enemy...
Bring out...your Deadly Queen...
I'm gonna end this...
Just now...you said Yoshikage Kira, didn't you?!
I'm gonna knock all the 'peace' right outta your face!
Koichi never keeps his promises, you know? I lent him some money ages ago, and he's never paid me back! The only future he's got is self-destruction!
Hey, hold it! You're not planning to do anything dirty to Koichi, are you?
If you wanna go, then let's go!
I found you! Now gimme back my wallet!
J-J-Jotaro's...daughter?!
You don't exactly look like a model student either, y'know!
Huh? Wait, what did you say just now?!
Uh, sorry, but could you not come any closer to me?
What did you say about my hair?!
Really? Alright then, I won't hold back!
What the? Jotaro... Did you get older?
I wonder if the current Jotaro's gotten weaker? Maybe I'll ask him...
Let's go, Mr Joestar!
Just leave it to me!
You look really young...
Don't tell me that's you, Jotaro?!
How can you fight without a Stand?
Nice to meet you, Mr Joestar!
You look so cool, Mr Joestar!
Watch my back, Mr Joestar!
Uh, it's okay, you know! It's not like I don't believe you or anything!
You wanna dance with us?!
You know what you just did?!
You wanna take this guy, Okuyasu?
As long as you're here, I can fight without a worry in my mind!
Bringing out your Stand is easy, Koichi. You just gotta think that you either wanna protect yourself...or beat the stuffing outta someone!
I know you always stick to your word, Koichi!
Fight together? With YOU?!
Did you say something just now?!
Trust me, I know full well how scary Harvest can be...
Shigechi! We're gonna work together to beat these losers, okay?
Relax, Giorno, I'll just heal you if you get hurt!
I was just thinking the same thing, Giorno!
Should I call you... Miss Jolyne?
Jotaro's daughter?! But she looks like a convict!
Don't you think it's a bit early for you to go senile, old man?
Mr Joestar... Don't tell me you're actually gonna fight like that?
This is gonna be trouble, Jotaro...
Wait, I haven't finished my mental preparation yet!
Of course, Jotaro!
You look even wiser than before, Jotaro!
Please don't push yourself, Jotaro...
I'm pretty sure Koichi should be around here somewhere...
He really shoplifted? Unbelievable...
So you're the one who owns Chili Pepper... You should have stayed hidden!
Get back, Koichi... And if something happens to me, I want you to run away without a second thought.
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
We're not gonna let you get away with that crap when there's this much money at stake!
I'm not gonna step down this time! Not a chance!
Hey! No funny business!
Why are you trying to run?
This guy just let one hell of a name slip off his tongue!!
I'm gonna knock all the 'peace' right outta your face!
Okuyasu! Which one should I smash first?!
Damn it! You bastard!
I have to go up against Jotaro? But Star Platinum's invincible!
He used to be even stronger than he is now? Are you kidding me?!
We have no choice. Let's do this!
What's his ability?
Both!
We're going to settle this here and now, you two.
I hope I never have to see you again!
Some people just can't get along, okay?!
I never thought I'd have such fun kicking my own ass!
Pretty scary guy, if you fall into his trap.
Whoa, wait a minute! Is this Mr Joestar?!
It does seem like I know you...but from where?
That couldn't be Jotaro. He's as good as me, or just a bit better. Who was he?
Heh! You were wide open, from your torso up to your chin!
He's huge like Jotaro, and his aura sort of reminds me of him, too...
Hmmm? Hold on a second, did that guy just say Joestar?!
Nah, couldn't be. The real Joestar isn't that macho!
I feel like I've seen this old guy somewhere before...
I'm sure glad you're my pal. You can use Reverb for some real crazy stuff!
Great! That's how you do it, Koichi!
Damn, Okuyasu, your stand is pretty scary! Sorry I ever picked on you!
That was great, Okuyasu!
Come on, knock it off! You hate me, don't you? Can't we just call a truce?
I'm not done kicking your ass!
Look Shigechi, I don't want any trouble...
Hey, I wanna thank you, Shigechi. I owe you one!
Bingo! Do I get a prize for beating you up even more?
I told you to rethink your stupid ideas, but it isn't the way you think that's messed up... It's your character itself!
Bastard! You won't get away that easy!
You're dead meat now!
Guess there's no way out...
Your Stand isn't meant for one-on-one battles!
Seems like you haven't gotten hungry enough for that peaceful life you want so badly...
I don't know the details, but it seems like Hayato Kawajiri did something that put you in a real bad way...
I thought that if I said all that, you'd lose faith in him and stop liking him...
Oh...really? Well, if that's the case, then sorry for getting in your way. Later!
Your Stand can heal too?! Awesome!
I don't have any allowance for you!
You could never beat Jotaro or me in terms of pure power!
ORA ORA? Sounds like someone I know...
Everyone has their own hobbies. Don't worry, I'll keep it a secret from everyone.
Are you trying to look as suspicious as possible?
Whenever anyone insults my awesome hairstyle, I get really pissed off!
Whaaat? Jotaro, were you going easy on me?
Maybe you haven't gotten that old after all...
Guess people are just powerless against the ravages of time... But I wouldn't sweat it if I were you, Jotaro!
Your next line will be: "You haven't won this yet!" Like that?
Great enough to blow you away!
Now that was some power! What happened to you, Jotaro?!
Joseph Joestar... That's my father's name...
He was so strong... So this is Hamon! And this is Mr Joestar's grandfather...
He was so strong... And he didn't even have a stand!
I forgot, if you compliment this old fart too much, he gets carried away...
You were only trying to look cool out there? Grow up...
I can't believe you can say that with a straight face... Not that I care!
We're the unstoppable duo!!
You really used your head out there, Okuyasu! Great job!
Great! I knew I could count on you!
You did it! Great job, Koichi!
I'm glad I had you with me, Koichi!
I was hoping to feel some warm friendship, y'know...
Geez... That was a really tough battle to fight.
Your Stand really is amazing! Awesome job, Shigechi!
(sigh) I knew you'd say that...
Great! You really saved my butt!
I think we get along pretty well!
I feel like I've seen that fighting style before... Do I know you?
This shock will be enough to blow your Stand to the moon!
They all say that before they get sent away... Don't worry, I'll go and visit you once every three days.
I was going to say I did, but you seem perfectly content with yourself...
Y-you weren't the least bit scary, you big loser!
Call me Josuke Higashikata, the man who turns the tables back on his foes!
And that's a wrap!
We won! How was I, Jotaro?!
Great! I can't believe you're in your 40s...
You're right... It's really creeping me out!
We already said enough! I'm sure she'll lose interest sooner or later!
The jackpot? Great! Do we get more prizes if we beat him up even more?
It isn't the way you think that's messed up... It's your character itself!
Where did you go flying to?! Get back out here, dammit!
So that's where you were, manga artist! I still haven't punched you enough yet!
Where did you go flying to?! Get back out here, dammit!
So that's where you were, manga artist! I still haven't punched you enough yet!
But I guess we're also in the wrong for trying to use him to make a little pocket change.
Sorry for punching you all of a sudden. I just don't want any trouble here, Shigechi...
You're dead meat now!
Bastard! You won't get away that easy!
Guess there's no way out...
Seems like you haven't gotten hungry enough for that peaceful life you want so badly...
You're both going straight to hell, Yoshikage Kira!
I still haven't punched you enough yet!!
Mr Joestar?! I always believed your stories about being stronger when you were younger!
Huuuh? We won, but, er...uh, sorry.
Don't worry, Koichi. I'll fix them both right up.
This guy's giving me bad vibes... My instincts are telling me to steer clear from him.
Hold up, hold up, hold up. I don't get it either. I need to get my thoughts in order...
Yeah! We're your worst nightmare!
Yeah!
Here we go!
Together now!
Let's gooo!
Let's gooo!
Let's gooo!
Let's gooo!
Yeah!
Leave it to me!
Roger that!
Roger that!
Roger that!
Roger that!
I'll start it off!
Here I come!
Perfect!
You've really done it now!
C'mon, don't make mom sad!
I healed your wounds! Wake up, Okuyasu!
Just open your damn eyes already!
Noooo!
Koichi!
Jotaro!
Yeah!
That was great, Okuyasu!
You know, Josuke, I think your hairdo's outdated...
Come on, Reverb!
Special Move!
Reverb 3 Freeze!
Think of what I've been through. Of course I hate you!
Protect my body! Act 3!
I need to fight, don't I?
Watch it!
Hmph!
Here I a—huh?! What's going on?!
Is someone's Stand causing this?!
Well...here we go, Josuke...
Easier said than done!
Here I come, Okuyasu!
Eek...
What a pain you are. So selfish!
Please stop attacking me with your Stand, right now! Or else...
Akira Otoishi!? What do you want!?
He's the one controlling the Stand? I never would have guessed...and geez! I can't believe he actually revealed himself like this!
This guy in front of me, he's the one! He revealed himself all of a sudden!
Your name is Yoshikage Kira...
You're cornered now, Yoshikage Kira!
Prepare yourself! There's no way out!
Gimme my passport back! Where's my luggage?!
Don't underestimate me just because I'm Japanese! I can still say "no" when I need to!
He's huuuge! He's gotta be over at least 190 cm!
Why is Jotaro wearing a school uniform?
That's Mr Joestar... He looks a bit younger.
What a tall old man. He's about as tall as Jotaro!
If she manages to catch me this easily...what'll she do to me?
Don't you see how much I don't like you?!
Jotaro, are you underestimating me?
I have to fight with Jotaro? I'm getting nervous already...
Ahh! C-could you be...Jotaro?!
Is it just me, or do you look even more imposing now?
But you look like a high schooler too, Jotaro...
I wonder how powerful Jotaro was in high school?
Mr Joestar... You look really strong!
Mr Joestar... Are you sure you're okay to fight?
Me too, Josuke!
Easier said than done!
Leave this to me, Josuke!
The Hand never fails, does it?
Okay...just make sure you concentrate on the battle, Okuyasu!
Hey, don't get your expectations up too high! You're making me nervous!
Okay, Rohan...
Please just try not to go out too far ahead of me!
I just can't bear to let you go out there alone. It feels too dangerous...
Don't push yourself now, Yukako!
Just agree with her, or else you'll be in for a world of hurt...
I'll protect Yukako!
You're... Giorno Giovanna!
You, of all people?!
Yes, please leave this to me!
I can fight too, you know! Reverb!
Okay! Let's go, Jotaro!
Yeah, let's do this, Jotaro!
Your silent nature is even scarier than it used to be...
What?! I can't believe he actually revealed himself to us...
No way! How?! I can't believe he came out of hiding!
What?!
What?!
I've grown too, you know! I'm powerful enough to stop the killer on my own now!
This guy in front of me! He's the one!
Josuke! Calm down!
Jotaro! This guy is...
We need to stop him! Don't let him push that switch!
Why? Why do we have to fight Okuyasu and Rohan?
Yukako! Snap out of it!
Yukako...
Don't underestimate my Reverb!
I hate you.
I never want to see your face again!
I won...but is this really what I wanted? Should I be happy?
Another me? What kind of Stand attack is this?
I feel like I'm getting the hang of controlling Reverb!
This is my Stand... I really moved it!
You're such an idiot, Okuyasu!
I have no idea what's going on here, but... I can see something!
I have to go to my cram school now!
Please get your Stand off me!
When did you get out of jail?
We did it! Jackpot!
This is for Reimi and Shigechi!
You're a complete idiot!
You're gonna pay for your crimes, you murderer!
An "accident"... He ended up dying in an "accident".
He was a pretty elegant guy!
I told you... Don't mistake me for a small fry.
That guy must be a student at another school. I've never seen anyone who stands out as much as he does...
Uhh, umm, er...that school uniform looks really nice!
That's weird... I guess you forgot who I am.
You have a Stand?! And it's pretty strong, too!
I can't believe you're this powerful! That heartless tenacity must have really strengthened your mind...
Say what you will... I'll never understand it.
I knew you were underestimating me, Jotaro. I've grown a bit, you know.
Yessss! He finally acknowledged my strength a little!
Jotaro... Looks like you really have gotten a bit older.
What?! This Jotaro's in his 40s?!
I did it! The young Jotaro acknowledged my strength!
Unbelievable... I never knew he was this strong!
Thank you! See, I knew I had grown a little!
The way he moved... This isn't the Mr Joestar I know!
I was only able to get this strong thanks to you, Josuke!
I think I'm getting the hang of this Stand thing now!
No matter how many times I see it, your Stand is just...great!
Thinking about where the space you chip away goes really gives me goosebumps...
Well, honestly, I don't really get how it works either...
We make a pretty good duo, don't we, Okuyasu?
You're not the only one who needs to grow, y'know...
Rohan, your pen speed's even faster than before!
I can't wait to read your next manga!
Stop being so dramatic, Yukako!
So far, so good! If I keep her happy, she'll let her guard down and I can finally escape!
Are you okay, Yukako?
Thanks for...helping me...
This is the last time I help you out, okay?!
Look with your mind, not your eyes...right, Jotaro?
We won! Did you see me out there, Jotaro?!
We did it, Jotaro!
Don't be silly! We only won thanks to you, Jotaro!
You've sure got a lot of energy for your age!
We did it! Jackpot!
He's dead... He died standing up...
I never imagined he'd get this angry...
He couldn't tell the difference between right from wrong if his life depended on it, but in a way I admire his passion. He really is a super manga artist...
You did it! You stopped time! Now the bombs won't blow up no matter how much we touch them!
My Act 3 is awesome!
That guy is in no position to be talking about hairstyles...
Act 3 Freeze!
Five-meter range achieved!
A-are you two...o-okay?
Yukako! Why are you doing this?! What's happened to our town?!
I'm begging you, Yukako...turn back to normal!
Now I'll splatter you! Reverb Act 3: FREEZE!!
Please!
Help me!
Jotaro!
Jotaro!
Jotaro!
Mr Joestar!
Yukako!
I'll help out!
Let's do this together!
Yes, master!
Yes, master!
Yes, master!
Yes, master!
I'll take care of it!
I'm over here!
I'll start off!
Whoa!
That was perfect!
Just leave the rest to me!
Just leave the rest to me!
Okuyasu!!
Just leave the rest to me!
How dare you touch Yukako?! I'm gonna make you pay!
This is my fault...!
I'll help out!
Nice haircut! Welcome to like, twenty years ago!
All this thinking is hurting my brain!
It's time to settle the score!
Grrrrrah!
The hell...?
This looks fun!
You're gonna have to deal with me now!
You just stay outta this, alright?
If you keep bugging me, I'm gonna erase you!
Ugigigi? What's going on here?
I don't get this, but I'm gonna beat you down!
Practice is fine and all, but I can't hold back with The Hand too much!
Josuke Higashikata, you'd better get ready to talk to The HAND!
How 'bout I take all of your sound away, huh? Mind if I try that?
Don't peep through people's windows, you stupid kid!
You know, Rohan, I always think that you look like someone I know. But who?
Move around all you want, you dumbass! I'm gonna flatten your Stand anyway!
Moron! I'm sick of hearing your stupid voice!
Hey, Shigechi, you lucky dog! Those St. Gentleman sandwiches have already sold out!
I'm ready to take you on! You're gonna be wiped right out of this world!
I'm ready to take you on! You're gonna be wiped right out of this world!
H-he's the killer...!
Slowly turn this way... Show me your face!
If it's "hands-off" combat you want, The Hand can do the business! Come on!
The Hand can chip you away without even touching you!
Shuddup! I don't have time to argue with an enraged psycho!
Oh no, here she comes again!
Huh? Who the hell are you?
Hm? Jotaro, why are you dressed like that?
What're you giving me the stinkeye for, pops?
Does this old man have a Stand?
Cream? That's a pretty cute name for a Stand! You going for laughs here?
This guy can erase space too?
I want a technique with a cool name too!
I seriously have to fight Jotaro now?!
I bet even I could beat Jotaro now! Wait, maybe not...
Huh? What are you doing here, Jotaro?
If you're really Jotaro, then let's see you bring out Star Platinum!
No one makes a fool out of Okuyasu Nijimura and gets away with it!
Who you callin' knucklehead?!
I know, it's just, my brain wasn't really made for thinkin'...
Then you'd better be prepared to die, chumps!
You just bumped yourself to the top spot on the Okuyasu/Josuke hit list!!
You wanna bash these heads in too, don'cha?!
Watch this, Koichi! Keep your eyes on my right hand!
I hear Reverb got a bit stronger! Show me what it's got!
I'm counting on you, Koichi! You and your Reverb!
C'mon, have a little more confidence in yourself, Shigechi!
I'd better not hear you whine about how you did the most work after all's said and done!
Tch! What a pain in the ass! Who cares, just as long as we win?!
I'm not THAT stupid! I've got my eyes locked right on the enemy!
You handle all the thinking stuff, okay, Jotaro?!
I'll do my worst!
Even Star Platinum looks like an old guy now...
This place is pretty big, so we'd have to cover a lot of ground...
Yeah, Koichi said it himself, so there's no doubt about it!
What did you just say?!
What did you just say?!
Hey, the promise was to split things half and half! You said that half of it would be ours, Shigechi!!
That's what I'm talking about, Josuke! We can't step down here! We can't let that little butthead get his way this time!
Huh? Where are you going?
Slowly turn this way... Show me your face!
Yoshikage Kira?! I can't believe we ran into him! We hit the jackpot!
This is...Yoshikage Kira!
So he's Kira, but the other guy's Kira too... Whaaat?
Okuyasu Nijimura's The Hand is going to wipe you all out!
For now, we'll leave you only half dead!
Bring it on! I'll swipe away your bombs and whatever else you throw at us!
I never even considered you a threat, moron!
Tch! You weren't even worth erasing!
I dunno what's going on here. Cuz I'm dumb, y'know!
You'd better quit talking that smack, dummy!
Well, you're pretty quick!
Koichi! You need to attack me with some bigger sounds, or else I won't be able to tell what's going on!
Whoaaa. You have a Stand too?
Now I know where I've seen ya! You're that chick from the Mona Lisa painting, right?
This guy's a maniac. He'll do just about anything short of sacrificing his own life in order to gather material for his manga!
You making a fool outta me, punk?!
Tch! Your mom shoulda named you ShigeCheapskate!
I learned something there, Chili Pepper.
Nobody messes with Okuyasu Nijimura and lives to tell about it!
I don't care what you're packing! I'll send YOU packing, chump!
Don't screw with me, you pig!
I've always wondered: Where does the stuff The Hand wipes out go to, huh?
You think we're just gonna sit here and listen to you explain yourself?! You're a pig whose only hobby is killing folks!
I knew this girl was mental!!
Eeeek! Let's get out of here while we still can! I don't want to have anything to do with this witch!
You think you can beat the great Okuyasu Nijimura? Not in ten million light years, nimrod!
You're not Jotaro! You're just some high schooler! You actually thought you could trick me?! Pullin' out Star Platinum and whatnot... Hey, wait a second...?
Did he just say Jotaro, or was I hearing things?
I said STAND USER! Have you gone senile or something?!
Eeeek! It's scary when space gets erased!
Stop copying my ability, you jerk!
"The Hand The World!" ...Sorry, I just thought it might work...
All this thinking is giving me a headache! I'm just gonna keep punching 'till I win!
Oohyoh! I beat Jotaro!
Huuuh? Was Star Platinum always that weak?
I knew it was you, Jotaro! But why do you look as young as me?
That's right! Whaddya think?! Was I awesome out there or what?!
Stop calling me that, dammit!
If it's simply a beatdown you need, I'm your man!
Yeah!
Well, Josuke, looks like we won!
Who cares about that? Just be happy we won!
How come you get three different forms?! That's not fair!
Yeah. You and me together make an unstoppable team!
You know, you're actually pretty smart... Maybe you just have sharp instincts?
I've had it with you!
If I can win without even thinking, that must mean I'm pretty damn strong, right?
You should stop dancing around and just punch 'em straight away, Jotaro!
Was that supposed to be a compliment? Whatever!
Yeaaaah! Jotaro complimented me!
You're so strong! You haven't changed a bit!
Doesn't it look like she's got a really happy smile on her face?
Maybe we should have said something worse... Like that he huffs paint thinner or something?
When someone insults his hair, he gets so angry that he loses sight of everything else, including manga pages!
He'll do just about anything short of sacrificing his own life in order to gather material for his manga!
You think we're gonna let you get away with this, you moron?!
If words won't snap you out of it, then we got no choice but to use our fists!
H-he's the killer...!
Your luck ran out the day you met us, you monster!
You ain't going nowhere!
You think we're just gonna sit here and listen to you explain yourself?! You're a pig whose only hobby is killing folks!
Now both of you can repent for your sins together in the afterlife!
I'm gonna swipe you right out of this world!
You...You son of a bitch! Are you planning on hogging all the glory?
Yeah! Did you forget?!
Let's go!
Help me out!
Jotaro!
Jotaro!
Jotaro!
Mr Joestar!
Yeah!
Yeah!
OK!
OK!
OK!
I got it!
Too slow!
Nimrod!
Yeaaah!
Awesome!
I'll just have to deliver two beatdowns on my own now!
Josuke... No way!
Koichi!!
Jotaro?! Dammit!
Leave it to me!
If it's simply a beatdown you need, I'm your man!
Yeaaah! We won!
What ludicrous hair!
Heaven's Door!
Oh my... This is incredible!
Your reality is mine!
What do you want? Is this some kind of practical joke?
Do you know what makes for an interesting manga?
You're starting to irritate me...
Honestly, you and I just can't get along.
Another one of me? If this were a manga, what a trite story it would make for!
Here I am. What's going on? Is this some sort of Stand trickery?!
I don't think you and I will get along.
This face... Could it be?
Hmph! Americans have such bad taste... They could never hope to understand MY art!
Mr Joestar? You look a bit younger...
Don't turn your face... At least say hello to me. I'm older than you, Josuke Higashikata.
Josuke Higashikata... I'm going to turn you into some research material.
Help me practice Heaven's Door a little! Sound good to you?
Yes! I like you! Readers are sure to sympathize with your personality!
Do I really have to deal with your crap? Did I lose some kind of bet?
Okuyasu... I had no interest in you, but so be it. I'll make "material" out of you!
Yukako Yamagishi... Haven't you ever thought about what Koichi wants? I think you're causing him a lot of trouble...
Oh, you're Yukako Yamagishi! How have you been? How's Love Extra?
I'm going to steal your reality, murderer!
You're the Morioh Town serial killer!
Bingo! Finally found you! Kosaku Kawajiri is really Yoshikage Kira!
I found you, Yoshikage Kira!
You're a fan of mine? Well, that's nice... Perhaps we may be able to get along.
Dear me, a lad with poor taste has arrived at my doorstep!
I've always wanted to give you a read, Jotaro.
Do you think Star Platinum can keep up with my drawing speed?
You're from the future? That means I'll be able to read even more experiences from your mind now!
If I win, you're going to let me read all your experiences.
Just you watch, Jotaro.
Time for you to show me just how strong you were in high school.
Mr Joestar has a Stand? Intriguing.
It's an honor to fight alongside you, Mr Joestar.
I'll fight with you, Josuke Higashikata. This is what they call "teaming up".
Curse you, Josuke...
Koichi, let's show them just how strong our bonds are!
I'll be the first to strike!
You'll fight with me, won't you, Koichi?
Jotaro! I need your Star Platinum!
I don't mind. After all, I'm taking a week off my serialization, thanks to a certain someone...
Jotaro, please let me read about what happened to you during your adult life.
Jotaro, are you sure you can fight? It seems like you've gotten really old...
That hairdo of yours is the funniest thing I've seen all year, Josuke! Your fashion sense is decades behind!!
I know you think that hairstyle looks cool, but it isn't doing you any favors! It looks positively horrendous!!
That hairdo of yours is the funniest thing I've seen all year, Josuke! Your fashion sense is decades behind!!
I know you think that hairstyle looks cool, but it isn't doing you any favors! It looks positively horrendous!!
I'll write it in right now. You will all "die here..."
Yukako Yamagishi... I used to respect how much you adored Koichi...
I wouldn't insult Rohan Kishibe if I were you...
Hmph... People with bad taste often have bad attitudes as well. That's why I dislike them...
Well, that was an unusual experience. I'll be sure to take thorough notes on it.
This is a pretty stupid idea, but I'd better write it down just in case.
Incredible! Hierophant Green, Magician's Red, Silver Chariot... Information on a wealth of Stands! This is it! I've found my finest reference material yet!
I knew it was you, Jotaro! Jotaro Kujo, born in 1970. Aquarius, age 17... Age 17?!
Don't bother reading my manga. You won't get it.
I never would have imagined that Mr Joestar was such a dangerous Stand user...
I'll be honest. Ever since I met you, I've hated you.
Thanks for the killer experience.
Guess my training's helped you improve a bit.
Perfect, Koichi! I'm going to make your reality mine!
I just remembered an errand. I'm leaving.
Hmm... A character like you could garner me a real solid fanbase.
I sympathize with you from the bottom of my heart, Koichi. As your best friend, it's my duty to stop this psycho from following you around!
Looks like I'm in superb form today.
You're too abnormal to be in my manga.
I'm not even sure it exists, but I'll write it in just in case. "Go to Hell..."
So this is how it ends for the murderer, then.
The law can't give you the punishment you need. This is what you truly deserve!
Want my autograph? I already got one for you. Special thanks!
This guy is...vaudevillian! I should take some notes on him just in case.
Now, time for me to read about everything that's happened to you!
I won! My pen's faster than Star Platinum!
Well, I won fair and square, so that means I get to read you!
A daughter?! You had a child...and you even got married, Jotaro!
Since I defeated him, I may as well read him a little. Let's see here...
There's so much perfect material here... I need to hurry up and turn this into a manga!
Hermit Purple is even stronger than I imagined it to be!
Wait... How can you possibly be that agile?
Why do you keep ignoring my instructions and acting on your own? You always do the opposite of what I want you to... That's why I hate you.
Watching you struggle to fight alongside me was actually kind of fun...
I feel like you can help me to grow even more... Thank you, Koichi.
I always feel like I'm growing when I'm with you, Koichi!
I got some great research done today! It's all thanks to you, Koichi!
They were nothing compared to Star Platinum.
I'm tired of having to take weeks off...
Jotaro! Remember what you promised me!
Such power! I can't believe you can still control such a Stand!
You really think that looks cool?! Hah!
Maybe if you're lucky, some filthy pigeons will swoop in and turn it into a cozy home!
You really think that looks cool?! Hah!
Maybe if you're lucky, some filthy pigeons will swoop in and turn it into a cozy home!
Say goodbye, Josuke Higashikata and Koichi Hirose!
It seems like her emotions have gotten out of control...or perhaps "distorted" is the better word?
Let's go!
Follow my lead!
I know.
I suppose I have no choice.
Don't mock me!
After me!
Not bad, I guess.
Incredible!
Now I have to do two people's work?!
I can't lose...for Koichi's sake!
Hmph!
Let me be frank here. Your hairdo sucks.
Get that perverse hairstyle out of my face!
Don't get on my bad side!
I'm going to crush you!
Could you stay out of my way?
I'm sick of looking at you!
Looks like I'm going to have to play rough!
Koichi, do you like me or hate me?
You little...
...piss-stain!!
Hmph! What an unreasonable man!
I need to go find Koichi, so...
Get in my way, and I will show no mercy!
If you want to live a long life...don't try any stupid tricks on me.
Why do I need to help you?
Stop talking to Koichi like you know him!
That's my line... I'm going to crush you to pieces!
Oh, have I met you before?
I need to go find Koichi, so... Get your stupidly big body out of my way right now!!
I'm sorry, mister, but I need to go find Koichi...
I need to hurry up and find Koichi... So get out of my way!
Shut up! I just saw Koichi over there. Now stay out of my way!
I don't know who you are, but if you want a fight, then I'll give you one.
I just can't stand it when delinquents like you mess with Koichi!
Oh no, I won't do anything. I, I can't... After all, Koichi won't even look at me...
From this day forward, I'm going to educate you on how to be a proper man! That's why I brought you here!
I'm going to make you love me! Or else...I might kill you...
You're always hanging around Koichi... Well I'm sick of seeing your stupid face!
Hey, have you seen Koichi around?
Rohan, would you please stop teasing Koichi?
You're awful... Just when I finally got Koichi all to myself!
Here's another man who has a Stand just like Koichi!
How dare you put Koichi through all that torment?! I'm going to make you pay, scumbag!
Yoshikage...Kira!
Why should I have to help you out with your stupid hobby?!
I heard what happened... You stole my Koichi's bag, didn't you?!
That price... Just what kind of a fool do you take me for? Make it cheaper!
Good afternoon... Have you seen Koichi? You'd better tell me where he is, or you'll be sorry!
Tell me where Koichi is! Please!
Could you please stay out of this, mister? I'm in a hurry!
Me? Follow Koichi around? Don't be silly!
Are you...worried about me?
Fight, Koichi... You have the talent for it!
I believe in you... You're the boy I chose, after all!
It's them again... Koichi belongs to ME, you hear?! I'm not going to let anyone else have him!
Koichi, your friends don't have very high opinions of you...
I'm going to crush you, Koichi!
Do you love me?
Now that my path is clear, I need to go and find Koichi!
You're going to assist me now! Understood?!
Koichi belongs to ME!
Get lost, you harlot!
Are you with those stupid delinquents? Not that it matters...
Hmph! It's your fault for not getting out of my way!
That's what I meant.<icon heart>So sorry...
Get gone, you old fart!!
Now you made me lose sight of him! How are you going to apologize for this?!
Hearing that from you doesn't make me the least bit happy!
Now no one stands in our way... You need to become a proper man...for my sake, Koichi!
Just what do I need to do to make Koichi happy? I don't understand...
Koichi belongs to ME! I won't let anyone else have him!
You mean were already thinking about how to save me, when I was trying to kill you?!
It's your fault for getting between our love!
Now, let me ask you again... Have you seen Koichi?
Can't you tell that you're only annoying Koichi?! Just stop hanging around him!
Don't ever get in my way again... Understood?
If I had lost, he would have blown me up!
Cut the sass, you moron, and just go to hell already!
I heard that you attacked Koichi. Time for you to atone for your sins!
This man is...abnormal!
It's your fault for tormenting Koichi, you dweeb!
Oh wait, there's Koichi now! I don't need a taxi anymore!
You "didn't see him"?! You'd better not be lying to me! If you know where he is, I want to know right now!!
I'm the one who's getting annoyed here! Just who do you think you are, you loser?!
Of course I'm talking to you! Now get out of my way, old man!
You don't know the first thing about us. We're COURTING each other! We're in LOVE!
Koichi, I... I'm so happy right now.
Eeek! We won! I'm so happy!
Yes! I felt your love just now, Koichi!
He doesn't even need to pay attention to me! Just thinking about Koichi makes me happy enough...
I can't stand it when stupid delinquents like you make fun of Koichi!
I love you... So I'll make sure that your death is as painless as possible...
Do you see now? Love is invincible.
Here I come!
Back me up!
Koichi!
Yes!
I know!
Coming!
I'll hold them back!
Let me help you!
Hmm... You weren't half bad.
You're pretty strong.
You're going to regret that!
What are you snoozing for?!
Not my Koichi?! I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to scatter your entrails all over the road!
Yes!
Hey chicken-head! Buckaw!
Harvest!
Go get 'em!
Everyone! Attack!
How 'bout them apples!
You're the loser, loser!
Don't even think about it!
Oh, I'm such a geenyis!
Can you see my Harvest?!
Many a little makes a mickle! And I'm 'unna make my mickle outta five thousand yen!
If you come any closer...you'll be sorry!!
You're suspicious!
You're giving me a bad feeling...
Me? Is that ME?
Me? This makes no sense!
You keep chasing me and I'll kill you!
I know you got the lottery money!
If you mess with me, you're gonna get hurt!
I could sell the sandwich to you for 10,000 yen if you really want it! Shee shee shee!
What did you say?!
You creep me out! Don't come any closer!
Sorry to trouble you.
I found youuu!
Ahem, ahem!
Okay, Josuke! Let's fight together!
P-people don't really compliment me that much.
Don't say that! We're friends!
I don't remember saying that...
Yaaaay! I won the lottery! 5 million yen, and it's all mine! Shee shee shee!
I'm 'unna smash you into splithereens!
Harvest! Steal the corpse part from him!
If you wanna be my enemy, I ain't gonna have no mercy!
Wowee, I sure feel better now! Don't ever come near me again!
Something doesn't feel right... I think it's time I head home.
Yeah, I understand... Understand that I'm stronger than you!
I told you...if you came after me...I'd kill you!
I'll make you an IOU in my notebook! That way you won't be able to play dumb!
No one can beat my Harvest!
You're too cocky for your own good!
My Harvest is invincible!
I-I warned you not to move!
Whoops, I wasn't looking where I was going. I'm sorry.
Bad guys like you aren't allowed to live in our town!
Shee shee! Shee shee shee shee! Someone complimented me again!
We won cuz of my Harvest! I worked harder than you!
Shee shee shee, shee shee shee! Okuyasu, I won!
Okuyasu, you hardly did anything! I pretty much beat them up on my own!
See? You guys aren't THAT strong...
See, your Stands aren't that great! It's only thanks to my Harvest that we got the 5 million!
Shee shee shee! Now the Noble One will give me lots of compliments!
We done did it! It's my corpse part! I got it back!
I'm gonna getcha!
Together now!
Shee shee!
I know!
We blew 'em away!
First strike!
You're pretty strong!
Wowee!
Just leave the rest to me!
Shee shee!
Your hairdo isn't rock 'n roll at all. It's got no soul!
Chili Pepper!
Maximum rockage!
YEAH!
This is it!
You know you love me. <icon heart>
You feel the surge?
Let's compare Stand skills, baby!
I rock harder than ever!
Damn, why do I have to fight YOU?!
I need something to take out all my anger and frustration on...
My dream is to become an ultra super guitarist!
There's only enough room for one ultra super guitarist around here!
Gaaaah! Don't tell me you're J-J-Jotaro Kujo?!
Hey, high schooler! Do you have a Stand too? Come with me for a minute.
Joseph Joestar... You're way younger than I expected you to be!
Take it away, Chili Pepper!
I'll shred your face off! Yours AND Joseph's!
Listen, Josuke. I've been acting real stupid. I need to rethink my stupid ideas!
Been waiting on you!
I have a firm belief that I'll be able to utterly destroy you in the end!
Can I get your autograph? Write it out to "My main man, Otoishi!"
Are you a manga artist?
I'm gonna show you just how lame your Stand really is!
You think you've cornered me?
Jotaro Kujo, uh...get out of Morioh Town. Please?
Eeeek! Wait, I want to go to jail! It's safer than out here!
No way, could you be...Jotaro Kujo?!
Waaaugh! Don't tell me you're J-Jotaro Kujo?!
Akira Otoishi, age 19. Pay no special attention to the guitar!
Heh heh heh heh heh! Were those your last words?
Get ready, guys!
Let me show you a REAL knockouuuut!
We're gonna have to break up here. Let's just say it's "creative differences"!
Behold what's in my heart! The ultimate irritation!
Yours truly, the ultra super guitarist!
Your electricity is mine now!
I...I actually beat Jotaro Kujo?! Yaaaay!
Gah hah hah hah hah hah! That was pathetic, Jotaro Kujo!
That kind of surprised me, but whatever! It's too late for you now!
Stop messing around with me, old man!
Gah hah hah hah hah!
I'm gonna put all the electricity I've used on your meter. Hee hee!
Let's be friends, okay? I think you and I could get along real well.
Koichi's nothing but a total pushover!
Thanks a lot! I appreciate it!
Pink Dark Boy? I might give it a read...if I feel like it!
Too easy, Okuyasu! Way too easy!
You're lacking in spirit... You can't get revenge if you can't outclass your brother!
I knew I was getting stronger! I beat Jotaro!!
Gah hah hah hah! I got a little panicked back there, but it looks like you were no match for my full power!
Don't play dumb! It's me, Akira Otoishi!
S-slammer? What are you talking about...
I'm gonna put all the electricity I've used on your meter. Hee hee!
Behold what's in my heart! The ultimate rage!
I finally expressed...my heart! And the scream of my soul!
I finally expressed...my heart! And the scream of my soul!
Let's jam!
Get on top!
Hell yeah!
Alright!
Hurry it up!
C'mon already!
That was pretty strong...
Nice one!
Time for a guitar solo!
Hell yeah!
Ugh, what a tasteless hairstyle!
I'm going to blow you to smithereens!
Got you!
Now I can calm down.
You saw me...
You... Are you alone...?
Whew... What a disastrous day.
I need to eliminate my enemies...
Wh-who are you?!
Is that...me?
A high schooler... Are you another friend of Josuke's?
You just saw my Deadly Queen, didn't you?
Are you another one of Josuke's allies?
You can see my Deadly Queen, can't you?
Josuke Higashikata... You must die here.
Oh no... I got too hasty...
I left the jacket with the buttons on it back there. I'll go pick it up later...after I eliminate you!
M-my driver's license. When did you take it out from my wallet? You rotten little shrimp!
My my... Rohan Kishibe? The manga artist?
How surprising... It seems you have an ability just like me.
Okuyasu Nijimura, I presume?
They saw my face... They know how my Stand works... And they know my name...
You have to die... I can't allow any witnesses to live!
You prevented me from sleeping, which means you're my enemy. Now I need to eliminate you before you tell anyone about me...
Beautiful... Your hair is truly mesmerizing, my dear.
I'm pretty sure this is Yukako Yamagishi...
Looking at you, I sense... myself. Who are you?
You're hiding something...
I'd like to learn your name and know more about you, but it's about time I vacated the premises.
I don't have time for idle chatter.
I have no choice! Now that you know who I am, I have to kill you!
Who is this man? How does he know about my name and my Stand?!
What? But there shouldn't be anyone alive who knows my identity...
You're my ally? Just who are you?
I'll accept that you're another me. But...that doesn't mean I completely trust you!
I'll detonate anyone who dares follow my trail...
I left the jacket with the buttons on it back there. I'll go pick it up later...after I eliminate you!
No... What are Josuke and Okuyasu doing here?!
What a day... Hands down the worst of my entire life...
Th-that's...Josuke Higashikata and Okuyasu Nijimura!
We're going to blow you away until there's no trace of you left...
You pursued us here, and for that, you will get no mercy!
Now to eliminate you and return to my days of peace.
I guess you're my only remaining enemy now...
You actually had me worried for a second. Nothing blowing you to bits won't fix, though!
There can only be one me... That way I can keep all my fun to myself.
I knew he was another Stand user... I'm glad I was able to take him out so quickly.
His Stand... Don't tell me that's Star Platinum?!
He's an experienced fighter! That was a close one...
I simply can't allow you to live...
I'm burdened with an unbridled need to kill... But I can still live happily!
I will survive...and live on in peace.
You despicable little brat!
It's your fate to be defeated here...
I guess this means that I'm not going to be able to read your latest work...
Curiosity killed the cat...
What a disastrous day... I, Yoshikage Kira, simply want to live out my life in peace... I can't believe I managed to get myself involved with such a piece of trash!
This isn't fair. Why do terrible things keep happening to me today?
Tonight...I'm going to sleep better than I have in a long time...
No one must follow my trail... No one must be allowed to find out who Yoshikage Kira really is. I just need to erase you...
Come to my place, and I'll take very good care of you, with only the purest of intentions...
...What an abnormal woman.
I'll be the one who drops bombs around here, thanks.
You have the same type of Stand as me?
Your Stand felt very weak... It was as easy to catch as a pop fly.
So fast... How could it be so fast?
I won! Now I can sleep soundly again tonight!
It was almost like he could predict my entire attack pattern... That was close!
I see... "You" are "me".
Now, time for you to explain what's going on here.
I will survive...and live on in peace.
My Deadly Queen's Heart Attack never fails to eliminate its targets...
This is the first time I've been pushed so far...by the police, or anyone...
It seems that I won't be able to sleep in peace. But only for tonight!
I don't care about winning or losing. but I will survive...and live on in peace.
And that fool named Okuyasu... Heh heh heh.
Tonight...I'm going to sleep better than I have in a long time...
How refreshing...
Ready?
Don't fail me.
Okay!
I suppose I have no choice.
Time to eliminate you!
I'm going to blow you away!
That's more like it.
I'm glad you're not my enemy...
I will survive!
So he does have the same ability as me...
Okay!
That hairdo... I haven't blown you up yet, have I? Heh heh...
Deadly Queen
The Third Bomb...
Aaaahhhh!
Ahh...ahhh...
Bites the Dust!
I'm at my limit! I'm gonna push it!
Yes! I did it! It worked!
Hu ha ha ha ha! I'm back to normal!
Bites the Dust!
My Kira intuition is telling me to carefully observe how this proceeds...
I feel like my karma is finally catching up to me.
I don't care who it is... If they find out who I am, they die.
I must remember... Even in awful times like these, there will still be chances to turn things around!
What on earth?
Is this... an enemy?
What?! Jotaro Kujo?!
What are you talking about? Bloodlust? You shouldn't taunt adults!
Oh, I'll go to work...right after I eliminate you!
Do you have business with me? Please don't make me late to work...
Josuke... Higashikata...
All I want is peace. Battle is the exact opposite of that. I hate it.
Urggh! What a cruel stroke of fate!
No great joy, but no sign of deep despair, either. A quiet life, like that of a plant's. That's the peaceful life I wanted...
This is a dream... How could I be cornered like this?
There isn't a single bit of trouble that Yoshikage Kira hasn't managed to avoid!
I'll detonate anyone who dares follow my trail...
Rohan Kishibe...?
The Hand... The power to wipe away space and teleport in an instant.
Okuyasu Nijimura...?
You're who? Yoshikage Kira?
This man...is me?!
Huh!? !? N-No way!
Wh-who are you?!
I'm Yoshikage Kira. Would you tell me your name?
Now, dear, I'd like you to cut my fingernails with this clipper.
Bites the Dust is an ability that was born from my burning wish to never see you ever again! Go on, come near me! Stop time! But how many seconds can you stop it for?
Go ahead, corner me all you want! When I reach my absolute limit, I'll just activate Bites the Dust!
Are you Jotaro Kujo? You seem a bit different...
Jotaro Kujo! He knows who I am?!
I know you better than anyone...
Relax. I'm on your side...
That's how it should be. Just use me for your own devices.
Urggh! What a cruel stroke of fate!
No great joy, but no sign of deep despair, either. A quiet life, like that of a plant's. That's the peaceful life I wanted...
Don't panic! There are two Yoshikage Kiras now. We couldn't possibly lose...
I must fight only those who know who I am!
No! I'm at my limit! I'm gonna push it! Now!
With our bombs...
We'll exterminate you right here!
You're next. I will eliminate anyone who finds out who I am...even if they're an ally.
Yes! I knew that destiny was on my side!
Better to err on the side of caution and kill you.
So you were out to get me. Thankfully I made such short work of you.
Impossible! How did you get younger?
Now I can relax for a bit...
Finished so soon? Now I won't have to be late to work. Heh heh heh...
You're the one who stuck your nose into my business, you idiot.
You'll never get me. Just watch.
It's easy to win a single battle... But that only creates stress toward the next battle... It's foolish.
Fighting with others is an endless cycle, and only creates sadness.
I told you that destiny was on my side, didn't I? In Japanese, the word destiny is written as "that which brings life"! Heh heh... That's exactly it.
Anyone pursuing my secret will get blown away.
I will allow no one to threaten my peace, no matter who they are, or how many...
Hmph. Thinking that you can't draw manga anymore right now, aren't you?
I'm going to scatter your ashes into the sky like morning dew off a leaf...
I heard that was a real scary Stand, but it was nothing.
Anyone pursuing my secret will get blown away.
To think I would meet Yoshikage Kira... is this an effect of "Bites the Dust?"
Did Bites the Dust send me back too far?
Heh heh, that'll do!
I can't believe that kid survived, but so be it... I've finished him off for sure this time.
I simply asked you what your name was...
You're rather cute... when your mouth is shut.
Ha ha ha ha! I beat them! Now I can be free!
Looks like I won't need to use Bites the Dust to go back now... Hu hu hu ha ha ha ha!
I eliminated you just to be on the safe side. Sorry if I had the wrong person... Heh heh.
I escaped... I'm safe! I'm free now!
Now, let's live out the rest of our lives in a positive manner.
I'd be in trouble if you happened to die now...
That's the spirit. You must survive for my sake!
Destiny has allied itself with Yoshikage Kira!
My Deadly Queen doesn't just blow up whatever it touches... It can easily make things explode at a distance as well!
Now I finally got rid of Josuke and that pesky healing ability of his!
Destiny has allied itself with Yoshikage Kira!
Hu... Hu ha... Hu ha ha ha ha ha! I'm back to normal...
Yes! Josuke Higashikata, blown to pieces!
It certainly feels refreshing, doesn't it?
Leave it to me.
Please help me.
Very good.
Hmph.
You're wide open!
I'll blow everything away!
Wonderful.
You're powerful...
I'm going to avoid this trouble!!
If you die, then I'll disappear!!
Very good.
My hair obviously puts yours to shame!
The power of the arrow!
Whoaaaaa!
Golden Wind Requiem!
Sincere actions will never perish.
You'll never reach truth.
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
MUDAAA!
It's all over now.
Haaaaah!
Sincere actions will never perish.
You'll never reach truth.
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
MUDAAA!
It's all over now.
I've got no choice...
This feeling! Something new is coming out from my Golden Wind!
Oh well...
Please, let's begin.
I'm already here? What the...
Is that me over there...?
Dio? Did you just say Dio?
Who is that? I've never seen him before...
Please step down if you don't want to get hurt. I hate having to say MUDA...
Does this man have a Stand?
You're Jotaro Kujo, aren't you? Jotaro, the man who killed DIO with Star Platinum...
Joestar? My name is Giorno Giovanna...
Look at him move... He's no amateur!
Jean Pierre? Is that really you?
I'm Giorno Giovanna. Nice to meet you.
Don't even think about following me.
No...it can't be you!
I feel like I've been... waiting for this moment.
Judging from your clothes, you must be a Japanese high schooler.
I thought I got away from you... Don't you ever give up?
It's you! How did you find this place?!
I'll say it again. Don't even think about following me. I hate saying the same thing twice, you know.
Huh? You're warning me? About what?
Looks like you're in a hurry. Do you need a taxi? How does 8,000 yen sound?
Here we go, Bucciarati...
You look like someone who came prepared... to kill. And if you're prepared to kill, then you're prepared to be killed!
I'm not going to hold back, Mista. Don't cry to me if you get hurt.
I'm Giorno Giovanna. Nice to meet you.
That must be the Li'l Bomber. I'm in trouble if he gets outta my range!
Let's do this, Narancia.
Aren't you going to get in the boat?
I heard your Stand is very dangerous...
Mind showing me your Stand?
Technically, my Stand can't heal. It only creates parts, which means that it can't alleviate pain.
In the end, only the truth survives.
Sincere actions born from truth will never perish...
Were your actions born from truth...or merely superficial evil?
Are you sure you'll be able to survive this, boss?
What a strange feeling. It's our first time meeting, and yet...
Oh no! She noticed me!
Don't resist and I promise that knocking you out is the worst I'll do.
Quiet, you. I like being alone, so just go away.
Are you the one who told Koichi to come investigate me?
You killed my father...
Are you my enemy, Jotaro Kujo?
I don't really like it when people call me "boss".
I'm getting a strange feeling from you...
When this battle is over, please tell me all you know about DIO.
Please don't do anything pointless that might hold me back.
This kid might come in handy... That's what you're thinking, isn't it?
I have something to ask you once this battle's over.
Joestar? My name is Giorno Giovanna.
I never thought I'd have to fight you like this...
Please show me your true power.
You're a Joestar, aren't you?
Please don't push yourself too hard now, Mr Joestar.
I'm not fighting for your sake.
I simply fight for the dreams I believe in.
Yes, I'm sure it only teaches them all the wrong things.
Shining Diamond... What a convenient ability.
I feel like you and I could defeat anyone who comes our way!
You can't handle this alone. Let me assist you, Koichi.
I'm not exactly enjoying this myself...
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream!
Of course!
We must win this!
We need to fight and get through this... Understood?!
I know, Narancia!
Your Stand should be perfect for this battle, Narancia.
Mista, did you forget? My Stand doesn't "heal," so I can't do anything about pain.
Lucky... Me?
I trust in each and every one of you.
I've seen the horrors of Purple Smoke firsthand... I need to be careful.
Fugo...
Trish, please step back.
Are you sure you'll be okay, Trish?
It's okay. I'll protect you, no matter what.
Don't tell me you're another Stand user?
Let's go, Jolyne... We have enemies to defeat.
Sorry, but please don't talk to me.
You call that a disguise?
Back to investigate me again?
My name is Giorno Giovanna, Jotaro.
You're saying you can trust me? DIO's son?
It's strange... Whenever I'm with you, I feel courage bubbling up inside me.
This wind...
Bucciarati... You're...
Golden Wind!
Are you sure you'll be able to survive this, boss?
Were your actions born from truth...or merely superficial evil? Time to find out.
Are you sure you'll be able to survive this, boss?
I'm just as eager to see what kind of father you really are.
DIO... Perhaps I was always fated to fight with you.
Just how much do you intend to keep using me?
Giorno...Giovanna...
Bucciarati. I'm going to defeat you...for your own sake.
Futile is futile, no matter how many times you try.
This is the last time I lend you my strength.
Now I know what you're capable of.
Bene! Looks like I win.
Is this some kind of Stand attack?
Please tell me about Dio Brando... My father.
This is such a strange feeling, but for some reason, it puts me at ease.
Didn't you listen to what I said? Here, let me see your wound. I'll tend to it.
What's this numbness I'm feeling?! It isn't a Stand?!
I just wanted to take a close look at the man who killed my father...
After fighting with you, I was definitely able to sense something within you.
No doubt about it: You're Jean Pierre, before he was put out of commission.
That was Silver Chariot just now...which means...?
Is this man another Joestar?
Ciao.
I'll use the power I inherited from you for my own dreams!
I've always wanted to meet you. But now that I have, all I can really say is...MUDA.
Your Stand and my Golden Wind are quite similar.
What in the... He's only got 12 yen in his wallet?
You went easy on me... You're a good person.
So, yeah, about your luggage: hate to break this to you, but I sold it off. My bad.
Koichi really found himself an unforgettable girlfriend...
Looks like I decided to talk to the wrong girl.
You all right, Bucciarati?
I'm going to defeat your boss and take over this entire town.
Now, show me your wounds.
What was that? How many of those things are there in total?
Bene! Once I had the timing down, that was no problem.
Narancia, I hope we can become good friends.
I suppose this is farewell, Fugo.
Purple Smoke... What a dangerous stand.
Her stand has a completely different ability from Emperor Crimson!
I'll make sure not to leave any scars, so please just hold still.
It's all over now.
Your "end" has no ending! That's the power of Golden Wind Requiem!
There's no road ahead for him. And he'll never, ever reach truth... He cannot even reach the final fate ordained for him: death.
There's no road ahead for him. And he'll never, ever reach truth...
That star on her shoulder... It looks just like the one I saw in my father's photograph! What's the meaning of this?
Only five dollars? That's not even enough to buy a pizza.
You want to know yourself? You really think it's that easy?
Wait a minute... This lady is a man!
If you were really that curious about me, you should have come in person. I probably just would have told you the same thing, though: MUDA.
You're a good person... You've got a scary face, but you're good deep down.
Did I do the right thing here?
Please...call me JoJo.
What's this warmth that's enveloping me?
DIO is my father.
I'm sorry for being rude earlier. I can tell now that you're no amateur.
You exceeded all my expectations as well! Wow!
What do you know about DIO...my father?
Do you know anything about this mark?
I feel the same way. I hope I get to see you again, Jean Pierre.
He's so fast! So this is how fast Chariot used to be!
My father has had no influence on me. I simply strive to achieve the dreams I believe in.
Well, that was tiring. I'll call a taxi to drive you back. How about 8,000 yen for a trip to the station?
I fight for my own dreams!
I'm prepared to use you for my dreams if the need arises, father.
I have no choice but to accept that we share the same blood...
Here, let me heal your wounds, Josuke.
For some reason, I feel like I can read your mind, as if we're old friends.
I only do what I believe is right.
We won! All thanks to you, Koichi!
I want to become a gangster!
Bucciarati...
Yes! I wouldn't have it any other way!
Thank you for coming with me, Narancia.
If you have all those guns, the least you can do is try to aim them a little better.
We're perfectly fine...thanks to you, Narancia.
I'm telling you, it's impossible! Act like a real gangster and stop struggling!
Yes. This victory is a testament to our strength.
Yes, let's go back and join everyone.
I never want to get infected by that again, even if there was an antidote.
It's still not too late, Fugo. How about lending us your strength?
You've grown so much in such a short time.
If you're hurt, I'll heal you. Please show me your wounds.
(Her stand should be able to give us a hint about the boss...)
Why are all female Stand users so tough?
Whew... What a pointless battle.
See, that's exactly my problem. I don't want people to think we're the same kind of person, so you'll have to excuse me.
It's pointless to put on a disguise that has absolutely no effect.
Please, just tell me why you wanted to investigate me.
I don't mind... Please, just tell me about your connection to my father.
...Jotaro.
I'm glad I got to fight with you, Jotaro.
Bucciarati...
Bucciarati... Your body...
There's no road ahead for you.
Your "end" has no ending! That's the power of Golden Wind Requiem!
No, there's no need to look for him. It's all over now... There's no road ahead for him.
Your "end" has no ending! That's the power of Golden Wind Requiem!
MUDA MUDA MUDAAA!
Trish, it was truly comforting to have you by my side.
Now, we both know the truth about our parents...
What a Stand... It has both overwhelming power and super-precise movements...
Please wake up, Bucciarati!
It's pointless, no matter how many times you try. And I hate doing pointless things. MUDA MUDA...
Please assist me!
Let's win this together!
Yes!
I'll help you!
Connect our attacks!
I'll take this one!
Looks like that really worked.
I didn't think you were this strong.
Your spirit will never die...
What a strange feeling...
Bucciarati...
I'll finish this!
Mista! Bullets!
Trish!!
Yes!
Ugh, what frightening hair!
Zipper Man!
Hah!
Stop talking.
Eat this!
ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI!!
Arrivederci! (Farewell)
I won't kill you, but I'll retire you for a while.
So you're the one I need to defeat!
Looks like we'll need to work together here.
Before I trust you, I want to get a good look at you.
Me?! What the hell?!
Don't come any closer. Who are you?
Are you... Jean Pierre, from the Coliseum?
What bloodlust! Just how much hell has he seen?!
Let's see who can drive their fist into their foe first.
He's...seriously planning to kill me. This one's special. When he says he's going to do something, it's as good as done!
Fire away, Mista. I'm waiting.
Fight me for real, Mista.
Let me see your Li'l Bomber. Come at me with all you got!
You don't need to hold back, Narancia.
I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do. I have no regrets... Despite the sad state of the world, I want to walk down a path I can believe in!
I want to feel the full force of your Purple Smoke.
I'm not allowed to answer any of your questions.
Trish, bring out your Stand. I'll take you on.
Your ability really is unstoppable... But it looks like it can only read my moves for a short time!
Using the ignorant simply for his own benefit...it's vomit-inducing evil!!
You discovered how to destroy the Requiem... Now, if you completely destroy mine...
A younger Jean Pierre? This should be good.
Isn't it obvious, Jean Pierre?
I'm going to place my bet on your noble preparation, as well as your golden dreams.
Are you prepared for this, Giorno?!
Let's do this together, Giorno!
Stay alert, Narancia!
I'll decide my own path...
You're late, Narancia! The enemy's right in front of us!
Mista! Bullets! You ready?!
Fire without hesitation as soon as you find the enemy, Mista!
I trust your marksmanship... You can do this, right?!
No, it looks like we're facing more trouble than usual this time. Let me go too.
You're still our ally for now, at least...right, Fugo?
Fugo... I'm going to trust you have my back.
Let's go, Trish... Do you know how to use your Stand?
You? Are you sure?
Some enemies are stronger than others... Here they come!
Perhaps the boss can only predict the movements of bullets and the arrow?
You discovered how to destroy the Requiem... Now, if you completely destroy mine...
Your life ends here, Giorno Giovanna!
I hope you're prepared...to be split into pieces by my zippers!
Next time we meet, I'm retiring you.
I knew you were dangerous! I need to eliminate you!
That can't have been Emperor Crimson's ability, can it?
You also can use Zipper Man? How can this be?
Yes, your Chariot was certainly formidable back in your heyday.
A Stand that excels in swordplay... Amazing!
I should never have taken your skills lightly.
Mission accomplished, boss. He's history.
You're as skilled with your Bullets as ever. Keep it up.
Don't let your guard down!
Concentrate your spirit! Don't you dare let up!
You should work on that aim of yours, Narancia.
When you meet up with someone from the organization, don't hide anything. Answer all questions honestly. Got it? You haven't "betrayed" the organization.
You need to control your Stand!
So the boss's daughter is a Stand user after all...
That's it. Strengthen yourself, Trish, so that you can protect yourself.
Didn't manage to predict your own loss, eh?
I'll never forgive you! You betrayed me again!
Everything's turning back to normal!
Yeah, let's meet again someday.
Sorry, but I can't tell you that.
I bet on you... So I'm going to trust you until the end, Giorno.
Giorno... Meeting you brought me back to life.
We're going to just keep on rising up! You prepared for that?!
Be more careful—and don't lose your concentration.
I see. Then let's go, Narancia!
Good! Now let's get out of here at once!
You've gotten even stronger, Mista.
Well done, Mista. And the same goes for your Bullets.
Yeah, we won!
But working together helped us finish faster.
You've gotten stronger.
I always feel more at ease working with someone I know.
If you can fight that well, then I won't need to worry.
I feel like I can really rely on you now... But whatever you do, don't push yourself!
But remember, you're still a teenage girl!
Looks like you failed to predict what I'd do...
Everything's turning back to normal!
Farewell, Giorno.
Mission accomplished...
Let's go!
Please back me up!
Yeah!
Understood!
Focus now!
I won't let you get ahead of me!
It's great having you by my side.
Those were some amazing moves!
Your soul is with me now!
Who's going to heal my wounds now?!
Giorno... I leave the rest to you...
Don't you dare touch one of my men!
Leave the rest to me, Mista.
I won't let them get away!
Trish!!
Yeah!
Let's go, Bullets! The point of impact is his ridiculously large head!
Let's go, Bullets! The point of impact is his ridiculously large head!
Right there!
No misses!
No misses! I hope you're prepared for this!
Pass, pass, pass!
Yahoo!
Shoot him up!
Yeeeehah!
That's what I'm talkin' about, Bullets!
Ain't nobody got time for a break! We got work to do!
I'll take you out.
Don't you betray us now!
Try anything funny, and I shoot!
Who the hell are you?!
Who're you?!
J-Jean Pierre?!
An expert swordsman, huh? Don't make me laugh!
I'll show you who's Stand is all that!
What's with the outfit? You think you're a gunman from some Western?
Mess with my Bullets and you mess with me!
Are you a newbie? I'll try you on for size!
If this is what you really want, Bucciarati.
My Bullets are a force to be reckoned with, Bucciarati!
I'll show you who's Stand is all that!
Whoa, whoa! I paid! I paid!
If we defeat the boss and go in order of talent, that makes me next in line to be in charge!
Why don't we test our Stands against each other?
That's what you think of me? That I'm stinky?
I have to fight YOU?! Fine, bring it on!
Lock and load, Bullets!
I ain't backin' down, dammit!
What are you babbling about? Let's go!
Wait, are you... Jean Pierre the turtle guy?!
Your Stand can heal people, right?
I've been keeping my eye on you, y'know... I can tell you're a lucky guy!
Let my Bullets handle this, Giorno!
They're all ready for battle!
Yeah, once I'm in range, it's bombs away!
I can't believe you even need to ask me that, Bucciarati!
...swiss cheese!!
No one can beat us when it comes to long-distance battles!
I'm taking you down!
Let's go get some food after this is done, Fugo!
It's been a while since we teamed up, Fugo. You haven't gotten rusty, have you?
Enemies! Trish, get back!
Really? Reaaalllly?
Ready? Don't get in my way, alright?
He isn't running! He's coming toward us!!
What's happening here?! Don't tell me we're going to switch bodies again!
Aim right between the eyes!
This is the last time I partner up with you!
Next time I see you, I'm gonna shoot on sight.
Stop moving around like some freak...
That isn't an answer to my question, you idiot!
So that's how Jean Pierre's stand used to be.
Guns are stronger than swords—OBVIOUSLY!
Ha ha ha! You... You're pretty funny!
I can predict exactly where you're going to change the trajectory, you idiot!
All this means is that you were no match for me!
I like you! Your ability is pretty interesting!
Hey, come on! Stop going crazy on me like that!
Hey, are you okay, Bucciarati?!
No machine gun is gonna beat my Bullets!
Oh, I remember now... I forgot to pay! Sorry, Narancia!
Later, Fugo. Next time we meet, we might be enemies...
Right on! That's what I wanna see, Bullets!
Maybe I really do stink... Guess I'll try some cologne.
There's no way I'd ever lose to you!
Whether you predicted it or not, I still smashed you!
I did it! I defeated the boss!
Are you kidding me!? Ha ha ha! That's pretty good!
I knew it was you, Jean Pierre!
Be gentle, gentle! No, more gentle, Giorno!
We didn't win because of luck, but because I'm really awesome. You know that, right?
Hey, it's just about time for lunch, Giorno!
If we're going in order of talent, that makes me next in line to be in charge!
We're invincible together, Bucciarati!
See? You didn't even need to ask!
I'm glad that you've got energy, but you need to try to aim a little better!
Yeah! Got 'em!
Good job, Narancia!
It isn't as delicious as our town's, but the food here is pretty good.
C'mon, let's go, Fugo! What's wrong? I'm not mad about the boat thing anymore!
Maybe you don't need us to protect you anymore?
Hahhhh hah hahhhhh... Ukekekekekeke!
That's my line...
We did it! Finally!
The boss's Emperor Crimson couldn't lay a finger on us! We finally defeated him!
No misses!
Let's go!
Sync up with me!
Yeah!
I'm ready whenever!
How naive!
Lock and load!
Not bad, man!
Felt like that worked!
I'll clean the rest of 'em up!
Giorno!
Bucciarati?! Answer me!
Narancia...no!
Dammit! Trish!
Yeah!
That hair's awful! I wouldn't be caught dead with it!
Li'l Bomber!
VOLA VOLA VOLA VOLA VOLA
Volare via!
How was THAT?!
Hah!
You're a bad guy!
I hope you're prepared for this, jerk!
Hey, I only teamed up with you because I was ordered to, okay?!
Don't hold me back!
Who're you, you bastard?!
Now I got it! So you're the enemy, huh?!
Hey, wait a minute! Aren't you Jean Pierre, the turtle guy?!
Some Chariot that was! Are you stupid or something?
You're two years younger than me!?
Heh heh! Get ready, Giorno!
I don't like this much, but I'll follow my orders, Bucciarati!
You serious about this, Bucciarati?
Ain't no way a pistol could beat a machine gun, idiot!
Mista! It's time you paid me back for that juice already!
I'm going to kill you, Fugo! I swear by god I'm gonna kill you!
Fugo... I thought you said you'd help me study!
I don't want to get you wrapped up in this any further, Trish.
I heard you got a Stand too, Trish! Show it to me!
I can do this! I don't care if you're our boss, you're outta here!
Urk! The boss just appeared in front of me, and I don't know anything about him!
Let's do this, Jean Pierre!
Jean Pierre? You mean THAT Jean Pierre?!
I trust your judgment!
I'm the older one here, remember?!
Urk! I'm getting nervous now!
I know there's no way I can lose if I'm with you!
Bucciarati... What should I do?
I know! I see it right on my radar!
Let's turn 'em into...
We're gonna shoot you down before you even get near us!
Hey, you'd better leave me some room to do cool stuff too! Promise?!
I know, I know! Leave it to me!
Don't order me around! I'm older than you!
Yeah, Fugo! I can handle it!
Don't push yourself! Just leave the hard stuff to me!
Trish, are you...scared?
I'll protect Trish!
Two beehives, coming right up!
Hmph! I just followed my orders! I'm not helping you out anymore!
Tch! I could have easily done that on my own!
That'll teach you to bite my style, jerk!
No way some fake could ever beat me!
Who knew that Jean Pierre the turtle guy was actually this strong!? Damn!
You think you can slice Li'l Bomber with that wimpy swordplay?!
That's "mister" to you! I'm the older one here, damn it!
Yeah! Li'l Bomber wins!
I'll do anything you order me to.
You okay, Bucciarati?!
Heh heh! Li'l Bomber wins again!
Huh? Wait...did I forget that you paid?
Sorry, Fugo. I promise to study hard. Just teach me some more!
Keep your promises! Lies lead to thievery, y'know!
If you can fight that well, then the wound on your arm must be fine now!
Yeah, I win! I'll help you practice any time you want!
I didn't know what you could do before, boss... but I guess it's no match for me!
Now it's all finally over!!
You just called me a kid, didn't you?!
Man, you really surprised me! I mean, the Jean Pierre I know is, uh... Actually, maybe I shouldn't tell you...
I just thought we'd get a little more hope with you...that's all.
Hey, don't you scold me! I'm older than you!
Did we do okay out there? What do you think, Giorno?
You're always so harsh, Bucciarati...
I'll follow you anywhere, whether I'm ordered to or not!
I did it!! Were you watching me, Bucciarati?
Shuddup! We won, didn't we?!
Mission complete!
I did a good job out there, right?!
Owww! That hurrrrts!
Why do I have to listen to you, huh?!
What?! R-really?
Trish, are you hurt?
When did you get so strong?!
We won! We're safe now, Trish!
You're both going straight to hell!
Let's go!
I'm gonna pulverize you!
Giddy-up!
Watch this!
Try this on for size!
No one's gonna stop me!
Yeah! Perfect hit!
Woohoo! That did the trick!
Grrr! You're gonna pay!
Oh no... Giorno!
How could Bucciarati lose?!
Mista... Now you've really done it!!
I'll end this in a jiffy!
Trish?!
Giddy-up!
Talk about some rotten hair!
Purple Smoke!
BushaaAAAAA
Ushaaaaaaaaa!
(cough, cough)
Rot in peace!
The definition of ferocity:
Attack like an explosion... And retreat like a storm!
I have to do this! It's too late to run now!
And what do we have here?
Be careful. If you try anything funny, I'll attack you, too.
Looks like we'll just have to work together to get out of this.
What!? How can this be!?
You! Who do you think you are!?
Why... Have you lost your mind?! What's going on inside your head?!
I don't really like bringing my Stand out, you know.
We can still turn this around! I'm going to stop you!
Bucciarati... I'll do anything for you, but...are you sure you're making the right decision here?
Mista! What's wrong with you?! You're going to be completely cut off now! Where do you think you'll be able to run to?!
Hold on, Mista! Stop screwing around!
You messing with me, punk?! Guess I'll have to beat you till you finally get it!
But you always end up forgetting no matter how many times I teach you...
Take off my jacket? Here? Uh...but why?
I have no choice but to kill you now.
No one can survive Purple Smoke's ability... Not even you, boss!
My virus may be able to stop his ability!
I'm counting on you, Giorno!
Giorno, I never thought I'd get to fight with you again.
Shall I go out alone?
Bucciarati, I...
Understood. Leave it to me!
You can do this! You can protect us!
I'm just saying you need to be careful! How many times do I need to say it before that rotten brain of yours gets it?!
As long as we stay calm, they're no match for us!
Please, just stay focused, Mista!
You're the one who betrayed the organization!
My virus will free you from your pain...
Let's just pretend like we never met, okay?
Unfortunately, I can't let you just walk away from this... I'm going to eliminate you.
Nice try, but you'll never best me.
Who are you!? Who do you think you are!?
Of course this happened! You were a fool to ever defy the organization!
Are you okay? Sorry, sometimes I lose my temper a little...
You've lost touch with reality... Nobody gets through life on dreams alone. We can't survive without the organization.
This is just proof that an officer like you isn't fit for battle anymore.
I can't let you go! I can't let you just walk into your own grave!
Please, enough with the stupid jokes. You know I can't hold back with Purple Smoke.
You're really something. Just do as you were taught, and you can make it happen.
Well then, let's hear you repeat the seven steps I taught you. Go on!
She's using someone's jacket as a handkerchief... What a girl!
Did I do the right thing? Was that really what I should have done?
This is the perfect way for you to die.
Yes! I finally defeated the boss!
Giorno, if you're with me, then I don't have to worry about getting infected by the virus.
Why did I leave the group back then?
I suppose I could have easily handled that on my own.
I decided that I wouldn't run anymore.
Please let me protect you... I still haven't paid you back yet!
Oooh, you've got a little bump there. It's pretty big, too!
In the end, you failed to listen to me...
Ahhh... Perhaps we overdid it a little?
I know we won and all, but do you always have to be so carefree?
Mista...I...
If you catch this virus...you're done for. There's no cure.
Here I go!
Time this right!
Coming!
Understood!
This one's for you!
I'll hold them back!
This is what happens when you mess with us!
Simply overwhelming!
I'll win, no matter what it takes!
I won't run anymore!
I won't run anymore!
Coming!
What happened to your head?! Someone needs to call the fashion police!
Spicy Lady!
Haaaaaaah!
WAAAAAAAANNABEEEEEEEEEE
Heh heh. That's certainly got some flavor to it.
Alright, you piece of trash!
Hah!
Haaah...
There's no turning back now!
I'm not gonna turn tail and run!
Whew... I'm so sick of teaming up with you.
(sigh) Why do I have to help you out, huh?
There's another me?!
Stay back! Who are you?!
Wait, could you be... Jean Pierre?!
Did the organization send you after me?!
I'm Trish... Who are you?
The organization must have sent you after me!
Show it to you? You mean I have to fight you, Giorno?
Will you help me practice my Stand? You can heal me with yours if I get hurt, right?
I have a question I'd like you to answer...
You'll help me gauge my strength? Okay.
I can smell that B.O. from here!
You don't need to hold back, Mista!
I'll be fine, Narancia.
Perfect timing, Narancia. I was looking for a sparring partner.
Could you take off that jacket? Don't worry, it's not like I want to see you naked or anything.
He ordered you to come here, didn't he?
I'm not going to get scared or run from the fate I inherited from you!!
I need to know the truth about my parents!
It's okay! I have a Stand too!
Wait, could you be... Jean Pierre?!
No, Giorno, I'll fight too!
Yes! Spicy Lady will protect me!
What the—? They're attacking us!
Yes, I'll be fine. I still lack a little confidence, though.
Let me fight with you, Bucciarati.
I don't need your protection anymore. I can protect myself with my own Stand!
Looks we'll just have to do this on our own.
Of course not! Let's go!
Okay. Watch my back, Narancia.
No, it'll be faster if we do this together!
You know... Your smell doesn't really bother me anymore.
I know... Let's just hurry up and finish this!
He's trying to escape, Giorno. I can feel it... He just took one step back!
That's Giorno's Requiem...
We can overcome this together, Giorno.
What are you trying to do?
Stop following me around.
This is the last time I pair up with you!
Did a Stand cause that just now?
That looks pretty real for an illusion...
But Jean Pierre, I thought your soul was inside the turtle... Why are you here?
Wait, were you really just trying to hit on me?
If this guy was really from the organization, he would have tried harder to capture me...
He changed his bullet's trajectory! Maybe his ability works like Six Bullets?
Well? This is my Spicy Lady!
Oops. Looks like I only ended up hurting you, Giorno.
Just who am I...?
This is my ability—Spicy Lady!
I said some weird stuff back there... I guess I just sort of panicked. It doesn't really bother me now.
Hmm... You're kinda weak, Mista.
I already figured it out...
Well? I'm pretty strong, aren't I?
I'm missing my handkerchief, so go buy me one. Oh, and get me the latest issue of Italian Vogue and a bottle of Givenchy N°2 Blush while you're at it.
I'm not going to run anymore. It's time for me to fight!
If you intend to stand in my way, I'll just climb above you!
I don't want to die without knowing the truth!
You're just a wannabe.
So this is the kind of man you were, Jean Pierre...
I only acquired this Stand thanks to you, Giorno.
Nothing I can't handle. Thanks, Giorno.
I'll do as you say. Not like I have any other choice...
What do you mean, Bucciarati?
You don't need to be so frugal with the compliments, you know!
See, I knew we could beat them!
Oh, that was nothing! Thanks!
See? I can fight too!
Good. Can you go do some shopping for me, then?
See? It went faster because we teamed up!
Kyaaaah!
OK! Mission accomplished!
Keep looking, Giorno! Find him! I can feel that he's still alive! We won't be able to rest easy until we know for sure!
Never let go of that arrow, Giorno! We can't let the boss touch it ever again!!
I climbed above you... I've won out against fate!
Don't let you guard down! This man is an evil creature who only ever thinks about protecting himself!
Help me!
Let's link this up!
Coming!
Leave it to me!
I'll take this!
scuse me!
You're strong!
Oh my!
I'll inherit your spirit!
Giorno!
No! Bucciarati!
Narancia!
Mista!
Coming!
The results are the only thing that remain! And as a result, you will be forever known as the man with a mountain of feces on his head!
The results are the only thing that remain! And as a result, you will be forever known as the man with a mountain of feces on his head!
I, Diavolo, am emperor!
What you just saw and touched...
...was your future self.
Let me end this for you.
Behold the power of my Emperor Crimson!
It's over now.
Emperor Crimson!!
I can push ahead all time aside from my own!
Time's flowing backwards?!
This is a trial.
I-I'm sorry, boss...yes...
My head...it hurts...
I can't believe I actually have to partner up with someone...
I need to seal up all the pitfalls that might endanger me! No matter who created them!
I am emperor!
The emperor is I!
I will always remain on the top!
You're below me, Jean Pierre! And as long as you're below me—in hell—it doesn't matter what you try to use the arrow for!
This a trial. I accept this as a trial to conquer my past!
Fate has decreed that I stand at the apex!
I've had quite enough of your conceited babbling!
The arrow belongs to Diavolooo!
I'm not even going to give you enough time to regret the fact that you're dead!
I will never let you get away!
You better go away now, Bruno Bucciarati... Approach me, and you'll die.
Look at me! Who do you think is more fit to rule?! Think it over again! Who is truly fit to hold the arrow?!
You're worthless!
Mista, the sniper...
Your radar is bad news... Guess I'll have to dispose of you.
Come at me, you poor excuse for Stand user.
You're Fugo, the virus guy, aren't you?
You've fallen under the illusion that your ability is invincible, and now you think you can defeat me?
Daughter of mine... I wish you'd never been born.
I need to seal up the pitfalls that threaten me!
Th-this can't be happening!!
Stop it, Bucciarati...
I aim to remain at the apex. If you escape here, and I lose that pride, it'll all be over!
You're certainly a threat, but my predictions will lead me to overcome you!
No... I can't run away from this!! I'll lose my pride... I need to defeat them here!
You're certainly a threat, but my predictions will lead me to overcome you!
Blood ties are such a nuisance...
As your father...I want to know what kind of Stand you have.
Now watch as I defeat you, and ascend the true emperor's throne!
You're next! I'm going to cut off this cycle right here!
No one learns who I am and lives to tell the tale! You're no exception!
Fate decided not to choose you.
You aren't the emperor... You're just a soldier.
BRING RING RING RING RING
Even if you cut up your past into tiny pieces...it'll still come slithering back up from beneath the stone, just like a worm...
If you've seen Emperor Crimson, it's already your time...nay, you're no longer in this world!
Ciao. Yes, Doppio speaking.
Yes! I won!
The future has chosen my Emperor Crimson!
It's overrrr!
I, Diavolo, have always been an emperor who rose to power through strife!
BRING RING RING RING RING
No one must be allowed to threaten my eternal seat on the apex. I'll erase every last threat!
Bucciarati! Controlling the arrow is no job for a weakling!!
Ciao. Yes, Doppio speaking.
A feeble insect like you could never surpass Emperor Crimson's prophecies... You'll never escape!
What a fitting ability for a bottom-feeding cretin like you.
BRING RING RING RING RING
Now, to give this weakling a fitting end!
Say goodbye to that radar.
Your virus is powerless in the face of Emperor Crimson...
What a pathetic Stand. You can't even control it properly...
Now you've pissed me off!
Now, to cut our blood ties once and for all!
The arrow belongs to Diavolooo!
Controlling the arrow is no job for a weakling!!
The arrow rejected you!!
I, Diavolo, am emperor! Just as I always was!
Allow me to thank you, my daughter. You claimed that I was planning to run...but your insult only helped me to retain my pride!
I, Diavolo, am emperor! Just as I always was!
Now I'm finally rid of those pests! The new recruit who betrayed me, and my own daughter!
Perhaps I had no need to fear you. Yes, there's no way my daughter's ability would contain any hint to the secrets of Emperor Crimson!
Victory! I, Diavolo, am the true emperor!
Assist me!
Follow my lead!
Hmph!
Very good.
You're no match!
Open your eyes!
Perhaps I underestimated them.
No one will threaten my reign.
My ability sits on the apex of truth!!
Hmph!
I've seen drag queens with better hair!
Stone Ocean!!
I'll knock you unconscious.
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!!
Man, give me a damn break...
This ends here!
I think I get it. I think I finally understand my dad.
What?
I don't like you.
The hell?! You look just like me!
Another one of me? Am I hallucinating or what?
Oh no, someone spotted me!
Who are you? Wanna fight?
JoJo... My mom used to call me that!
Who said you could talk to me?!
You're... so young! What's going on here?
This guy is...!
Looks like you've got a Stand too!
It's not a tattoo! It's body art!
I don't know you! Stop talking to me!
Um, thanks. So, uh, who do you think you are, John Wayne?
My father's uncle?! That makes you my...uhh...
That uniform... You're one of those Japanese delinquents!
I feel like I know you somehow...
Hey! You stole my wallet just now, didn't you?!
I've got the perfect strategy for your stickers.
He saw me... I want to die! I want to jump off a cliff and diiiie!
Anastasia?! Think you can take me?
Who are you again? You were in that room with Emporio, right?
Weather! How did you know where I was?
Weather... Your memories...
Puuuuucchi!
I never thought I'd be able to unmask you this way—that I'd come face to face with you again like this!
Come on, Father Pucchi!
If you're going to bring it... then bring it now!
Well, looks like we've reached a new dawn for the human race!
If you're gonna cross-dress, you should at least put some effort into it.
Hey! I nearly got killed over here, and you're off playing around in Japan?!
Is that you...dad?
You have no right to act like my father anymore!!
Whenever I see you, you always give me some bad news. Like you're gonna leave mom for a few years, or divorce her, or something.
Is that you, Weather? Are you Weather Forecast?
If you're pissed, I'll help you let off some steam. C'mon!
I'll be fine, Mr. Gentleman.
Okay! Just leave the rest to me!
Shuddup! Or else I'll sew your mouth shut with Stone Ocean!
Well, I don't mind hearing that.
Don't order me around. You're younger than me!
You step down, you stupid kid!
You step down, you stupid kid!
You're pretty buff for an old guy...
Are you my grandpa...err, my great-grandpa?
Sure. And I'll call you Josuke.
What? If you've got any complaints, tell them to my dad!
Do I even need to answer that?!
You'll help me out, right, Giorno?
Let's go, Ermes!!
We'll take you on!
We need to win no matter what it takes, Ermes!
Anastasia, back me up!
No, I'll fight too, Anastasia!
Anastasia... I trust you.
I'm counting on you, Weather!
I know it's kinda awkward to say this here, but...
Weather! Let's kick their asses!
That costume better be the only joke you have planned!
That's some really heavy makeup, dude.
Thanks to SOMEONE, I have a Stand too!
Why? Let's just bust them up together!
Hmph... Like I need you to tell me that!
Shuddup... Don't order me around like I'm your daughter or something!
I don't just want to make it through this! I want to beat the crap of out of 'em!!
Sure, I'll lend you a hand.
Wait, don't tell me...
Excuse me! Aren't you forgetting someone?!
Watch out! That guy can turn Stands into discs and steal them!
He probably just wants to show off!
Yeah right...
Okay, Anastasia. You can pop the question... And I'm not just saying that because we might die here!
We can't run from this!
But how?! Did we let him figure out something we shouldn't have?! Something that will let him complete his ability?!
He wants to finish things once and for all, and close the book on the Joestar lineage!
You know something about this?
Okay. In order to bring Weather back to normal... I'll beat him to a pulp!
What he's saying sounds completely different than before...
Dad...you countered his ability?
What, you got something to say?
Back to hell with you!
Guess you only resemble me on the outside!
This must be just a hallucination my soul is showing me...
I kinda feel like he might have believed I'm innocent...
Did you go easy on me? Well aren't you just the perfect British gentleman?!
Why do you seem familiar? Just who are you?
Don't ever come near me again!
Maybe I'm just fantasizing too much... I grew up without ever getting any love from my father, so I guess I can't help it.
Shuddup... Don't order me around!
Who is this guy? He kind of reminds me of dad...
His Stand is made of vines? Maybe I could learn a thing or two from him.
I hate guys like you!
Draw! Let's see who's the faster one! ...Gotcha!
On second thought, you do kinda look like dad...
How do you flip people off in Japan? Like this?
For some reason, I don't really feel satisfied. Is this guy really my enemy?
You need to stop doing this crap, or you're really gonna regret it later...
See? I told you I had a strategy.
He saw me doing "it"... Y-you know, the word that starts with "ma"...
The hell's gotten into you, Anastasia?!
That's one crazy ability...just who are you?
The mark on his shoulder... It's the same as mine!
I'll stop your Stand, Weather!
You're the worst kind of evil. An evil that doesn't know it's evil!
I'm going to steal two things from you—my father's memories, and your life!
Now I understand...that you don't understand a single thing.
Don't you get it? You lost to fate.
Sorry, let me rephrase that. This is the TWILIGHT of the human race...
Manscaping is like, Cross-dressing 101! Get with the program!
I always wanted to give you a good fist to the face!
Hey, wake up! I have a lot of questions for you!
You can go now. And don't come back!
NOW you finally come and see me, after I've been thrown in the slammer? You call this love?
He's got the same Stand, too! But he looks younger than me...
I won't go easy on you, though!
I told you I'd be fine!
You're really tough...
I'm gonna copy that string trick of yours.
What, did you want me to fight like a wuss?
I'm the one giving orders around here. Got it?!
Hmmm... I guess you've always been a little strong.
Hmmm... I guess you've always been a little strong.
What are you staring off into space for? You okay?
Let's just chalk it up to the Joestar blood, rather than my dad...
I felt the same thing... I wonder why?
If you keep standing around, I'm gonna leave you here!
We kicked ass out there! Total victory!
That's it? Give me a damn break...
Take this, you punkass!
Nice knowing ya!!
Yeah! We won, Ermes!
Thanks for the help, Anastasia. Hey, Anastasia? Are you listening to me?
Huh? You were looking at me? The whole time you fought?
It's over! The battle's over, Anastasia!
You're close...too close...
Why do you keep getting in my face like that?! I knew I shouldn't have to come to you for help!
I'm glad I had you here, Weather...
Give me a damn break...
Heh heh heh heh...
You've got some nerve, you know that? Seriously, give me a break...
It's your fault I'm like this! YOUR FAULT!!
It finally got through to me. I think... I think I understand my father.
What? You're telling me this NOW? Have you lost your damn mind?
Dad!
Wes, you really remind me of someone I know...
I'd never mistake that Stand! It's exactly the same as Weather's!
Give me a damn break!
Generation gaaap!
Oh, just admit it, you were trying to show off too, weren't you?
We beat them... Well, this is awkward.
I sense hope in the way you think...not darkness.
I'm gonna go right up to him and beat him down!
Dad...
I don't know where he is, but he's hiding himself and trying to get near us!
They're quite the aggressive duo...
Weather! I'll wake you up!
Pucchi seems like a completely different person...
He's so strong! I've never seen my dad like this before!
Say goodbye!
Help me!
Yeah!
I got this!
ORA ORA ORAAA!
Me first!
Oooh, nice!
Nice one!
I'll land enough punches for you, too.
You got hit?!
Anastasia...no!
Weather! I wish...
I wish I could talk to you again...
In that soft breeze...
Give me a damn break...
Yeah!
You nasty-ass pompadour-lookin' dumbass freak!
Get ready!
This'll finish you off.
And this! And this! And this! And this! And this!!
Don't funk with me!!
Who the hell are you, you bastard?!
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
Aw, man! Fine, I'll try to work together with you for now!
Watch your back. I might accidentally put a sticker on it...
Why am I over there...?
You're creepy! Get the hell away from me!
MAN!? Are you blind?!
Wait, don't tell me you're Jolyne's...
Huh? If you mess with me, you're leaving in a bodybag!
Oh my God! Who the hell are you?
Sorry, Jolyne, but I know exactly how to counter your string!
Saw you...what? What were you doing?
You're a weirdo, alright, but you ARE strong...
Man, this dude looks like a lady...
I know you! You're that ghost from the music room!
Now that I think about it, I've never fought you... Time to see what you've got!
You're saying my sister was fated to die!? Screw you!
You came here just so I could kick your ass!
Are you Jolyne's old man?
Huh? You look a little young today, Jotaro...
Since you're Jolyne's old man and all, it'd be rude if I didn't go all out!
Want me to stick one on you?
Weather? Hold on, what are you doing?!
Why are you thinking about dying!? There's still a ton of fun, lucky stuff that might happen to you!
You're Jotaro...right?
Jotaro Kujo?! No way!
Jotaro Kujo?! No way!
Yeah! Let's knock 'em right out!!
We've got company, Jolyne!
We can pound anyone who comes our way!
What? What are you talking about all of a sudden?
Back me up, Anastasia!
Yeah, I guess.
You're a younger version of Jotaro?
It feels weird to fight alongside you...
Yeah, let's beat 'em into next Monday!
Of course! You won't even need to do anything!
Jolyne! I'll smash you to pieceeeeees!
Talk about a bittersweet victory.
Next, I'll smack some stickers onto you!
Um, I am awake, right? Columbus discovered America in 1492... Okay, I must be.
Come near me again, and I'll rip you apart!
Tch! Serves you right for messing with me!
Sorry, guess I had the wrong person. You're clearly younger than me...
What are you on?! Idiot...
You piss me off, creepshow!
Yes! I beat you!
Just what did he see you do, huh?!
Did I overestimate your strength? Or underestimate my own?
I knew you were a dude! It was really hard to tell at first!
He punched me! Wait, does that mean he's human...?
Oh my God! That story about you being able to control weather was true?!
Now I understand... You were fated to lose here.
Go and pray to your god or whatever.
Guess I got the wrong person... There's no way Jotaro could be this weak.
I knew you had gotten younger! And you're faster, too!
Jotaro really is strong...
Well, Jotaro? Don't underestimate my stickers just 'cuz they're small!
You're the one who picked a fight with me! This is on you, buddy!
It's not always Monday!
Hey, when you have your kid, make sure to pay attention to her, alright?!
That was Star Platinum... There's no mistaking it!
That was Star Platinum... There's no mistaking it!
Gah hah hah! Look how scared they are!
You picked the wrong people to mess with!!
I have nothing to fear when I'm with you, Jolyne!
Have you lost your mind? You're really freaking me out...
Thanks to you, that was a cinch!
I don't need you to tell me that...
Why don't you pay more attention to Jolyne, man?
Tch! Stop it! I don't need you to thank me.
Jolyne's old man really packs a punch...
Yeaaaah! Was that hot or what?!
My stickers dealt them a world of pain!
Ready to go?
Hurry it up!
I got it!
Yeah!
So dumb!
I don't think so!
You did it!
Wow! Sweet!
Time to give fate a little payback!
Jolyyyyyne!
No way! Jotaro?!
I got it!
I'm going to pluck your ridiculous hair from the inside out!
I'll dispose of you!
Diver Drive...
I dove into your body itself.
I can kill you from the inside out!
Diver Drive!
Diver Drive's already inside your body.
I'm gonna destroy you!
Are you our next enemy?
What's your name?
Just keep to yourself and stay out of my sight...
I just keep seeing this big sign over your head flashing "I'm going to be your next enemy"!
Huh? Another... Me?!
I'm gonna take you apart!
Don't worry about me. More importantly, where's Jolyne?
I know who you are...Jotaro, right?
Adorable... Ohh... Jolyne, you're just so adorable...
Yes... That's how it should be. Stare at me more. Those eyes... I need more...
So you're Jolyne's friend, right?
Man, this lady looks like a dude...
Hey, Weather... Just what's your relationship with Jolyne, huh?
I feel like I'm getting rusty. Lend me a hand, Weather.
I'm afraid you must die... so that Jolyne can live.
Damn you, Pucchi!!
Jotaro... Where is Jolyne right now?
Please, Jotaro! Give me Jolyne's hand in marriage!
I'd like to ask for your permission, Jotaro...to take your daughter's hand in marriage...
Perhaps this isn't the time, but...all you need to say is "OK".
Move it, kid. I don't have time to deal with you...
Weather! Watch where you're going!
I'll protect you...
Jotaro, once this battle ends...please allow me to marry Jolyne!
Jotaro, once this battle ends...please allow me to marry Jolyne!
I'll protect you, Jolyne.
Jolyne, just step back.
Don't leave my side, Jolyne.
Ermes, do you mind if I stand next to you?
Make sure you tell Jolyne that I helped you out!
Weather, just what are you?
Weather, enemies!
What are you talking about, Weather?!
Relax, Jotaro... I'm here.
Wait, Jotaro... How old is Jolyne "right now"?
If I manage to survive this...I think I'll propose to Jolyne. Heh heh ha ha ha...
I want you to set my soul free! When this battle ends, please approve of the marriage!
Jotaro... I'm confident that I can protect Jolyne even better than you can!
Hey, Weather! Are you sure you know where Jolyne is?
Wait... Is he not even aware that he has a Stand?
Tch, fine! I owe F.F. a debt as well! I'll go with you!
He's afraid... The priest's face is trembling with fear!
If I manage to survive this...I think I'll propose to Jolyne. Heh heh ha ha ha... You know, I really might just do it! Ha ha!
I need to kill that priest if I want to protect Jolyne!
It's too late for us to get out of this, but I'll make sure we survive... In return, please give me your daughter's hand in marriage!
First, Diver Drive receives the initial damage...
I'll dismantle you...
Just don't get in my way, and I won't kill you.
Sorry to keep you waiting. Now it's your turn to get pummeled.
THIS is how you dismantle something.
Disassembly complete! Now I'll never have to see your stupid face again!
Dammit, where are you, Jolyne?
I don't really care why you look so young all of a sudden... Just let me marry Jolyne! If I can just hear you say yes, my soul will be saved!
If you've come to your senses... Then I want you to feel how I feel.
Do you have any...kinks? I'm pretty sure you already understand how I feel...
Don't worry... To me, hurting Jolyne's friends is like hurting Jolyne.
So you ARE a woman. Stop confusing me!
(There's only one person who can really protect Jolyne—me!!) What? I didn't say anything.
Finished already? Tch... That was lame.
I may be a condemned murderer, but as least I don't cling to some silly god.
Go to hell, you bastard!
Jotaro, please! Give us your blessing!
Thank you, Jotaro! I promise to cherish Jolyne with all my heart!
Jotaro! Just say "OK"...
Just one word... "OK"...
I won't dismantle you, so just get out of my sight.
Did you lose your memories AGAIN!? Snap out of it and tell me where Jolyne is!
Jotaro... You aren't meant to die here.
Please, Jotaro! Say "OK"!
Please, Jotaro! Say "OK"!
(Jolyne... So adorable... How can one person be so adorable?)
Jolyne, you look so beautiful when you fight...
That's it... Move up right next to me...
I might be able to see Jolyne if I stick with you.
Just don't forget our promise, no matter what!
Don't you remember who you really are?
You picked a fight with us... You should just feel lucky to be alive!
I can't do anything that would make Jolyne sad!
In that case, Jotaro, I'd like to ask for your permission regarding this one thing...
Oh, I bet she's just so adorable! She always has been!
I was, uh, just kidding... Ha ha!
We won, Jotaro!
You're Jolyne's father, aren't you? You need to think seriously about what would make her truly happy!
Don't play dumb with me! That mark on your shoulder is...huh?
Weather, your Stand is just too dangerous... You can't go using it whenever you want.
We finally got you! You're right in Weather's range!
It's over! We defeated the priest!
Jolyne...
Do it! Finish him off, Jolyyyyne!
She has the purest heart and intentions, which she inherited from you her father... They illuminated my dark heart, and saved it from the brink of ruin!
Go to hell, you bastard!
Diver Drive... "Dismantling complete"...
Assist me!
Here goes!
Okay!
Yeah!
Are you blind?!
I'm gonna destroy you!
Now THAT was a beating!
That was a pretty good one.
Stop getting in my way!
I'll kill anyone who hurts Jolyne!
Weatherrr!!
Jotaro?!
Okay!
Did your head get struck by lightning or something?
Gah hah hah! What a lame-ass hairdo!
Weather Forecast...
Weather Forecast manipulates weather.
Weather Forecast...
Weather Forecast manipulates weather.
Get away from me... I'll kick you to death.
Do we need to fight this out?
Stay out of my way.
All I can say is that you're my enemy.
Huh... There are two of me now?
Is an enemy Stand doing this?
I can just sort of tell...from the air.
I hear you've got a Stand too...
I can just sort of tell...from the air.
You need to pee? Just go and do it in the corner.
I hear you've got a Stand too...
Show me how powerful your stickers are...
...What are you talking about?
Fine... Bring it on.
I finally found you, Pucchi...
I've heard about you... It's time you gave my memories back.
Jolyne, leave this to me...
What, you need to pee again?
Got it!
Save it for later, Anastasia... We've got company.
Yeah...
When this is all over...kill me, Anastasia.
I'm going to finish everything here, retrieve the memories of Jolyne's father, and get revenge for F.F. Once I've done all that, I want you to kill me...got it?
Say goodbye, Pucchi!
I want to wreak total chaos...
Even I can't stop my ability. It's coming from the deepest recesses of my heart.
Get in my way again, and you're next.
You're next on my list. Bring it on.
I guess the only "weather" you can control is a gentle breeze...
No...that's clearly me.
I just want to know who I really am...
You know who I really am, don't you?
I just want to know who I really am...
Don't worry. I'll suck it up in my clouds. If you drop your undies, that is.
A ghost? Me?
Ermes, was it? No wonder Jolyne trusts in you.
Anastasia... You're not making any sense to me.
I'll deal with you... So just don't do anything annoying, Anastasia.
You know who I really am, don't you?
We won! We avenged F.F. and saved Jolyne's father...
You okay, Jolyne?
You'll just have to go do it over there. You don't need a cloud this time, do you?
This is all I can do for you...
That's what I want to find out, Anastasia.
Guess I overdid it...
You're the only one who can stop me from going berserk!
I've finally caught you...
You're the worst kind of evil. An evil that doesn't know it's evil!
The Noble One will guide us to heaven... Even the cursed ones like me...
All I have left to hope for is that I might reach Heaven...
Help me out!
Here goes!
I'll help you!
Yeah!
I'll stop you!
Stay out of my way!
Okay, that worked!
Excellent!
Let's go!
Now!
Die!
Gah hah hah hah!
Take this!
What are you looking at?
Whoa... Not bad.
Not bad!
It's my turn now!
I'll be fine on my own!
Jolyne... I'll finish this in no time.
I won't let your efforts go to waste!
I'll win this!
I won't let your efforts go to waste!
I'll help you!
Oh maaan... That hair! Oh maaan!
Gah hah hah! What a lame-ass hairdo!
Weather Forecast...
Weather Forecast manipulates weather.
Weather Forecast...
Weather Forecast manipulates weather.
Hey, if you know who I am, would you mind telling me?
Stay away from me...
Oh maaan... I can't pair up with someone like you!
Tch! What the hell is going on here?
If I can't die, then...
I guess I'll just have to kill myself by my own hand.
Who are you?
This has nothing to do with you... Stay out of it.
I don't have any beef with you, but...
I can't die no matter what I do! Dammit... Why only me?!
Are you strong? Strong enough to kill me?
Who are you? I've never seen you before...
Satisfied? Perla—your sister—ended up this way because of what YOU did!
I can't control my anger... I want to end this once and for all!
Jolyne, was it? What do you think you're doing?
There have been a lot of strange things happening around me...
Jolyne? What are you talking about?
Do you know something about all the strange things that have been happening around me?
Who are you?
I don't have any beef with you, but...
I'm never teaming up with you ever again.
I don't know what you're after, but this isn't happening again.
I finally did it...
It's all over now...
Does this woman know who I am?
Your name is Jolyne, right? You're an odd one.
Dammit... I guess I really can't die on my own...
Fun? You really think there's anything like that waiting for me?
Why?! Why can't I die?!
If you're going to fight me, then fight me...and don't stop until you kill me!
What did he just say? "Brother"?
Perla... I'm sorry...
That's why you helped me? Weirdo...
Weather? How do you know my nickname?
There's no mark on my shoulder... What are you talking about?
My Stand? Do you know something about what this power is?
If you're going to fight me, then fight me...and don't stop until you kill me!
Fun? You really think there's anything like that waiting for me?
I'm counting on you.
Let's go!
Okay!
I'll join you!
I'll handle it!
Let me go in first.
You're strong...
Excellent!
Let's go!
Now!
Die!
Gah hah hah hah!
Take this!
What are you looking at?
Whoa... Not bad.
Not bad!
Leave the rest to me!
I'll be fine on my own!
Okay!
Quit acting like you're special with that flashy hairstyle!
As long as I understand the secret to this weather phenomenon, I don't need to be afraid of touching any snails!
I just extracted my eyesight!
O Lord, please guide me!
I can feel it! This is the spot!!
Maiden Heaven. Time, accelerate!
Acceleration will take us to our final destination! The universe will completely loop around!
A new world! The human race has reached an endpoint and entered a new dawn!
This is Maiden Heaven!
This is the power of Pale Snake!
I'm taking your discs!
O Lord, please guide me...
You're mine...
Excellent...
So it was already done...
You were one move...too late...
No one can divide prime numbers!
Do you believe in gravity?
Hm?
We must love even our enemies.
By the will of God, I will smite you, impostor.
Destiny has allied itself with me...not you.
This is the young Jotaro Kujo!
It appears that you have a Stand too... I suppose I'll make it into a disc.
How far will you reach? I want to join you.
You're a king amongst kings.
Your destiny ends here.
Daughter of Jotaro! I must bring you the utter oblivion of death!
You will not escape! This ends here, no matter what! This karma must not be taken into the future!
The most important thing here now is your death... Through it, all your allies' hope will shatter to pieces.
Don't you understand how destiny works? You'll just have to die, then.
Don't bother... The likes of you could never serve as a proper trial for me.
Never let childish emotions get the better of you!
Don't take another step toward me, Anastasia.
Weather... You were cursed from the day you were born.
I know your ability like the back of my hand, Weather.
Jotaro Kujo... I suppose I could finish you off ahead of the others.
Now that you've defeated DIO, your disc will serve me well!
You share a common Joestar flaw, Jotaro Kujo... Your daughter is your weakness.
Ggh... Jotaro Kujo!
Wrong... I'm your older brother.
I don't mind becoming a murderer, if it will help me get rid of you.
I'll follow you anywhere.
The thought never occurred to me...
DIO... I'll do anything for you.
People must go to Heaven! Every human goal points toward it!
Stop it, Weather! You're making a mistake! You're the cursed one here...
I imagine it's beyond your comprehension, but I'll tell you one last time just in case: Time will accelerate.
I'll strike you down with every ounce of strength in my body!
Oh Lord in Heaven, please give me guidance...
The pride and courage of the Joestar bloodline is what allowed them to triumph over destiny.
It will all end here.
I need to defeat you all for the sake of the future.
DIO, I won't let you die... I'll cut off the Joestar bloodline right here and now!
Begone. I'll just pretend I never saw you.
Everyone receives an equal amount of God's love. Even people like you...
Die like the martyr you claim to be.
My goal is far loftier than pathetic ideals such as justice!
Now Jolyne Cujoh will never be born, and DIO will survive!
This disc... Star Platinum? Jotaro Kujo?!
I love you as I love God Himself!
I've never thought about that before. I like people who help me grow.
Now, nobody can reach me...
All I care about... is obtaining what is born!
Destiny is on my side... Destiny is lifting me up, telling me to go to Heaven!
It appears that my ability...has been completed.
Praise the powers God has granted me.
Your destiny ends here.
All people must go to Heaven, and you're getting in their way...
You are but a flea on the vast plain of eternity!
Your life is utterly beyond salvation.
Weather, you need to die, along with all your memories. You're an evil being...
Now I just need to kill his daughter... Then the Cujoh bloodline will end!
Well, that was a bit surprising. But now, DIO, I can travel to your world!
Seems you were two seconds too late...
The Joestar bloodline...the Cujoh bloodline! Are they what stands in the way of the plan that DIO and I created?!
Weather, you need to die...along with your memories.
You're an evil being... People without memories are no different from corpses.
DIO, let us journey into your world together!
I like people who help me grow—like you, DIO...
Yes... We must reach our Heaven...
You're only getting in the way... The tiny sacrifices are nothing compared to what I will achieve!
Destiny is lifting me up, telling me to go to Heaven! Do you believe in gravity? That is why you came here...
It appears that my ability...has been completed.
Remember: I do not seek strength. I seek the happiness that all mankind must reach.
You, the Joestars, are the ones who gave me strength!
You share a common Joestar flaw, Jotaro Kujo... Your daughter is your weakness.
All karma must be left behind.
Your deaths are but small sacrifices for the sake of the happiness of the entire human race!
We overcame our trials...and the Joestar bloodline lifted us up!
Attack!
Assist me!
It's time, DIO.
Together now.
Very good.
Okay!
I'll strike first!
Let me begin!
Bless you...
That's more like it.
I will inherit your soul!
H-How could you lose?
H-How could you lose?
Together now.
Quit acting like you're special with that flashy hairstyle!
I just extracted my eyesight!
O Lord, please guide me!
I can feel it! This is the spot!!
Maiden Heaven. Time, accelerate!
Acceleration will take us to our final destination! The universe will completely loop around!
A new world! The human race has reached an endpoint and entered a new dawn!
This is Maiden Heaven!
Only need one punch.
Gravity, reverse!
This is a revelation...
Haaaah!
Just one strike.
No one can divide prime numbers!
Do you believe in gravity?
Hm?
We must love even our enemies.
By the will of God, I will smite you, impostor.
Destiny has allied itself with me...not you.
This is the young Jotaro Kujo!

DIO, I won't let you die... I'll cut off the Joestar bloodline right here and now!
Let us sing praises for the new Heaven!
His power extends even to zombies...
Lay down your burdens. Entrust everything to DIO...
Begone. I'll just pretend I never saw you.
Everyone receives an equal amount of God's love. Even people like you...
Die like the martyr you claim to be.
My goal is far loftier than pathetic ideals such as justice!

Farewell, Kujos...
For those who would sneer at Heaven...this is a suitable fate.
Even now?! Can you still not fathom the sublime wonder of the Eyes of Heaven?
Attack!
Assist me!
Together now.
Very good.
I'll strike first!
Let me begin!
Bless you...
That's more like it.
I will inherit your soul!
H-How could you lose?
H-How could you lose?
Together now.
I love your hair! It's the craziest thing I've ever seen!
This is what Lesson 5 was for...
Got you!
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!
Thanks...Gyro.
This is what Lesson 5 was for...
Got you!
Chooomeeeeen!
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!
It was such a long, roundabout path...
Thanks...Gyro.
That's all I can think of to say.
This smell!!
I'm still in the red! I just want to make it to zero!
I'm going to get the corpse and bring myself back to zero!!
What are you after?!
This is my only way to escape!
Dang, that guy looks just like me!
Huh? What am I looking at?! Is this one of President Valentine's tricks?!
You are the inheritor! You have to starve if you want to win. Starve nobly!
I want to learn how to use the Spin! I have to!
Make me believe you!
This is what Lesson 5 was for...
Dio? But that's impossible... I saw him die with my own eyes!
That's Dio! The genius jockey from the royal British equestrian world!
What?! This guy knows about the corpse?!
Did the president send you after me?! I'm not gonna hand over the corpse!
You look...really bored...
Do you know what a "bug bite fetish" is? Well, they turn me on! End of story!
I'll do it, I'll do it!
Help me out, Higashikata!
Let's deal with these guys first, then we'll talk.
Be careful, Gyro! He's noticed us!
Grrr! I'm gonna crush you if it's the last thing I do!
Yeah, of course! I've been thinking about nothing but that... Wondering what I need to do to create a spin like that...
It can deflect any manner of attack... I saw it with my own eyes just now, within that gap!
We have to figure out some way to get through this! Let's go, Gyro!
They're all coming for us all at once!
A tag team of monsters who've both surpassed humanity... We can't let them get near the corpse part!
Gyro! How can you fight alongside Valentine?!
This was a one-time deal!
Next time we meet...I'll...
Why did I attack? What happened here?
You didn't disappear... This isn't the President's trickery?!
Just keep growing stronger... It'll be the "inheritors" like you who win in the end.
Gyro, teach me more Spin techniques!
It's all over...
It'd be so great if I could just believe that you're a good person...
The president did this... This is a Dio from another dimension, with a different ability!
I won... I beat Dio... I'm number one now!!
Save my wife and child? What are you talking about?!
This guy's Stand is a total mystery...
Yikes! That sounded really good! Too good! It's stuck in my head now! Especially the "rella rella" part!
Whoa! That's the craziest thing I've heard all year! Your old man is nuts!
See? We won, Gyro!
Japanese people are extremely polite, which actually just creeps me out.
It may sound presumptuous of me, but I think you've really grown.
No, Gyro. You were winning. You were clearly ahead of him! And his horse was about to collapse! Forget the rules!
Lesson 5? Isn't it a bit late for that?!
What kind of a Spin did you just throw?!
I sensed an air of integrity in those men just now... They possess a nobility that I lack.
Now's hardly the time for that! We've still got Diego to deal with!
Eat nail bullets, you damn monsters!
Gyro...don't you recognize me?
Please help!
Now!
Yeah!
I'll handle it!
Allow me!
Keep it going!
That was really good!
I see this isn't your first rodeo!

Thanks...Gyro.
Yeah!
Your name must be whack-a-mole, because I want to stomp your silly looking head down!
The Golden Spin...
Steel Ball Infinite Spin Energy!
The yet unseen power of the Golden Rectangle...
Now I feel like a winner!
The Golden Spin...
Surpassing the dimensional wall!
Steel Ball Infinite Spin Energy!
Burst!
The yet unseen power of the Golden Rectangle...
Right, here goes!
Here goes!
Watch out... I might hit you with a Steel Ball by accident.
I don't like you... You're actually my least favorite type of person.
Okaaay, stop right theeere! Don't take another step toward me!
What the... Me?! Is the President's ability doing this!?
What do you want to say here? If you're gonna give me a piece of your mind, do it!
Spin lessons are hard work. Can you keep up?
You have to let a horse run free. Let it go where it wants, as if it's thanking the land and sky for letting it be born here.
I'm gonna settle things with Valentine right here, right now!
Hey, what gives?
I'm going to etch "I can't beat Gyro Zeppeli" right into your brain!
Hey Johnny, I just came up with a song... Music and lyrics both by Gyro Zeppeli!
My real name is Julius Caesar Zeppeli. My father came up with it...
Time to start your lesson, Johnny!
I know that, Johnny! We're gonna get him before he gets us, got it?!
I'm...gonna crush you beyond all recognition!
Hey Johnny, do you remember this? The yet unseen Spin...the one that no one knows how to create...
Yea, me too. The despair inside my heart just lashed out at everything—up until this moment, that is.
Are they competing in the race too? I don't see their horses anywhere...
Here we go, terrorists!
Now! I'm going to crush you! Beyond all recognition!
Yeah! Into tiny pieces!
I'm not a kind man... Go to the doctor. And make sure you get there by lunch...
You really piss me off!
This is your fault... Coming up to me like some kinda creeper!
You mean the President wasn't doing this!?
You may be right... I need to be hungry.
Listen... The power of the Spin is a weapon itself. Don't forget that.
This is the power of the Steel Balls, which the Zeppeli family has refined over the past 250 years!
Grazie to my ancestors... Thanks to the Zeppeli family's technology, I was able to defeat a supervillain!
You don't have to fix your bad habits!
Now I'll blow you even farther away...
Pizza mozzarella, Pizza mozzarella! Rellarellarellarella! Rellarellarellarella!
If you actually did tell someone about that, I'd be more embarrassed for you!
Yeah, that's it, Johnny!
You predicted that I would never beat Dio... Well, what do you think now? Tell me the truth!
This isn't what it meant when I said I'd beat him beyond all recognition! This isn't what I was aiming for!!
Johnny! Ready for Lesson 5? I think that's the next one, anyways!
The Golden Rectangle, Johnny!
We won, so why do you look so down? Let's hurry on ahead, Johnny!
Eat my Steel Balls...and say goodbye to this world!
This is what it means to be beaten beyond all recognition. Nyo ho ho!
Nyo, ho ho ho! Flawless victory!
Here goes!
Let's finish this together!
I got it!
Sync up with me!
Chew on a Steel Ball!
After me now!
A fine attack!
That's how you do it!
There's no turning back now!!

This is Lesson 5, Johnny!
The long way around was our shortcut...
The long way is always...
the best shortcut.
I got it!
The first thing I'm going to do in office is outlaw that ridiculous hairstyle!
Consider this an honor!
The only one who can move freely between this world and the next is me!
Taste it long and slow.
D4C!
Wh-what?!
D4C!
Filthy acts, at a reasonable price.
I get it now...
Everything I do is for the sake of my country!
It is only through sacrifices in battle that we acquire valuable results!
Get ready for amber waves of pain!
Hello, me. Meet the REAL me.
From this point on, whoever makes the first mistake will lose it all. Will it be you, Gyro? It certainly won't be me...
I only have one question for you now Gyro Zeppeli... Why are you still riding your horse?
Battle is a part of every trial, and is always accompanied by bloodshed!
There will be a sacrifice made here...you, Johnny Joestar! This trial will end in bloodshed!
Dio... Do you really know about my ability?
Don't get cocky, now! I can execute you whenever I wish...
Fine... I'll enlist you.
With your dinosaurs and my D4C...
From this point on, whoever makes the first mistake will lose it all.
Why aren't you two running away? Why are you preparing for battle?
Now, show me the extent of your capabilities...Johnny Joestar...
Star Platinum... Precise movements, superb energy, and even the ability to stop time...
I have a duty to protect the safety of my people!
There will be a sacrifice made here...you!
I'm the one who will pick up the napkin first!
The core me is the one that was born in this unique world...
It appears that Valentine was always one step ahead of you...
Those Steel Balls are certainly scary... But I still won!
The stronger the foe, the better the trial!
Battles and bloodshed are a part of every trial! The stronger the foe, the better the trial!
The corpse is pulling out a new ability... D4C is evolving!
You're pretty arrogant for a filthy beggar!
What would you like as a reward?
Strength in numbers.
Who made the first mistake? It certainly wasn't me.
What a horrifying phenomenon... The Infinite Spin energy of the Steel Balls! But it ends here!
This won't do... You won't be able to defeat him at this rate!
At this rate, you'll accomplish nothing. Have we...no hope at all?
Come with me.
Lend a hand.
Okay!
I suppose I have no choice.
I'll strike first!
You're wide open!
Always impressive.
So it wasn't all just talk.
I'll use your power well.
Okay!
You really think that hairdo looks cool? I actually kinda feel bad for you...
USHAAAAAAAA!
I'm gonna kill you dead!!
This winner is me!
The World... Time is mine and mine alone!
The World... Time is mine and mine alone!
This is where the fun begins...
And time moves again...
Dio is the victor!!
Dio is the victor!
The World... Time is mine and mine alone!
The World... Time is mine and mine alone!
Time's stopped...
This is where the fun begins...
And time moves again...
Dio is the victor!!
Dio is the victor!!
URYYYYYY!
Money's what I'm after.
Let me teach you the meaning of the word "retire"!
I'm going to rise to the top of society!
Tsk!
Trash...
Who is this?!
This is...Dio!! Another me!
Everyone has bad habits. Even machines.
This is Gyro Zeppeli?! He feels different than before!
This is the Johnny Joestar I know... It doesn't seem like anything's changed.
This guy used to be a pro jockey?!
When his ability is active, and someone gets pressed between two things, they return to their world!
I want to make a deal with you. I'll find the corpse, then you'll buy it off me!
Pay me, and I'll help you.
You're saying you have a way to outnumber them?
I'm going to teach you the meaning of the word "retire"!
Come near me again, and I'll chew you to pieces.
Don't fail me now, monster...
WRRYYY! Cut through them!
You, Johnny Joestar, are my greatest trial!
I'm going to cut your flesh into pieces, then line all your organs up on the ground!
Hmph!
You're all just pigeons...
Only I know the truth...
This Dio will be the victor!
It's not like telling you this will break your bad habits... Just as no one can change their fate.
I won! Both the race and the next corpse part now belong to Dio!
How did you move when time was stopped?
I never thought I'd meet someone outside the traditional British equestrian world who possessed such technique...
I won! You've just proven all the weaknesses I guessed you had!
C'mon, make a deal with me! Give me Manhattan Island!!
Hmm... How about your house, Mr. President?
More like tyranny of the majority.
I won! Now everything belongs to Dio!
I told you I'd chew you up if you got near me...
MUDA MUDAAAAAA!
Resistance is futile against dinosaurs! MUDAAA!
I'm going to slice your head right off, Johnny Joestar!
I'm going to use the power of the corpse to rise to the top!
Assist me!
You ready?
Do whatever you like.
Fine, I'll help you.
What's wrong?!
I'll hit first!
You're not half bad.
That was a decent attack.
You served me well.
Hmph...
You really think that hairdo looks cool? I actually kinda feel bad for you...
USHAAAAAAAA!
I'm gonna kill you dead!!
This winner is me!
The World... Time is mine and mine alone!
The World... Time is mine and mine alone!
This is where the fun begins...
And time moves again...
Dio is the victor!!

You're not half bad.

You served me well.
Hmph...
That's some effed up hair.
Soft & Wet!
Pop!
I just stole your friction.
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!
ORAAA!
I'm winning this one!
This is my problem. I want to go myself, to see and hear for myself.
I need to investigate my bloodline.
Jackass...
Can't let my guard down now...
What in the hell are you?
Who are you?
You're Johnny Joestar... The man who used the power of the corpse to save his wife and child.
President? Corpse? What are you talking about?
How can you say something so stupid with such a straight face...?
Huuuh?! She blocked your phone!!
Hey, wait... You've got it wrong. Just listen to me...
I want to go to school. And I want a cell phone.
Sure, let's fight together.
I have a lot to ask you.
Can I really count on this guy?
Why would I do that?!
I know, of course!
Stop it, Joshu, that's rude!
Don't know. This is the first time I've seen it too...
Answer me! Which one is Yoshikage Kira?
What were you thinking?
Stay away from me!!
I don't get it.
Tell me your name! What's your profession?!
Looks like the Legend of the Joestar Statue wasn't just a fairy tale...
What's this corpse you keep talking about? Explain yourself.
I still don't know anything about the Higashikata family. But I can't let my guard down...
Joshuuu! This wasn't the deal!
I'm telling you, I didn't steal it!
If I go to school, I might be able to figure out what I like, what I'm good at, and learn more about who I really am.
I feel like this guy holds the key to my secrets...
Now I can find out the truth about the Legend of the Joestar Statue.
Joshu... We're friends, right?
We need to defeat anyone who gets in our way.
Stupid Joshu... Ah well, I guess I'll let him do as he wants.
If that's how you always act, it's no wonder you get shook down all the time.
Joshu... So this is your ability...
They're both Kira? What the hell?
Please help!
Come with me!
Yeah!
Okay!
Over here!
You finish them off!
You're strong!
Fantastic!
I'll get payback for you!
I need to do something about this.
Yeah!
Thugs don't style their hair like that anymore!
Th...This is...
Wait... I'm the one doing this!
Uhehhhh!
Take that!
I have to do this?!
Screw you!
Why do I have to babysit you, huh?!
I'll help you out, just don't go getting cocky!
S-someone's disguised as me!
You better not have laid hands on my Yasuho!!
Yasuho's my girl! She even lets me give her kisses...deeeeep, hot ones!
Don't try anything funny with my Yasuho!
You rotten thief! I knew you were gonna go and do something stupid sooner or later!
Why do you want a cell phone? Just who the hell do you think you're gonna talk with, huh?
I'm gonna help you out. OK?
What'll it be, Josuke? Wanna go home?
I'm only fighting with you because I trust you, Josuke!
Pfft! What a loser! Hey Josuke, look at that guy's head!
Now listen up! Yasuho is miiiiiine!!
I don't like you! I'm gonna crush you!
Stop acting like we're friends!
Hey, you only won thanks to me! You'd better not forget that!
See, the real me is way more suave and handsome!
She even lets me give her kisses...
RERORERORERORERO!
I didn't lose to an idiot like you...and I never will!
Why are you giving me that face? You're the thief here! What, are you mad that I've got you totally cornered?!
Do you live under a rock or something? Uhya hya hya hya! You can't get a cell phone if you don't even know your own name, stupid!
What are you talking about, Josuke? Of course! You're family, after all!
That's what I wanted to hear! I knew you had it in you!
See?! That's what happens when people mess with us!
I HATE delinquents like them!
RERORERORERORERO!
Have you learned your lesson yet, shitbrain?
Assist me!
C'mon, let's go!
Tsk!
Okay, okay...
Over here, stupid!
Idiot!
I did that!
Eh, mine was cooler than yours.

Use Hamon Breathing to charge the Hamon Gauge. Hold the button to continually charge it, which will strengthen your Normal Attacks, as well as some Powerful Attacks. When you activate a skill, it will automatically strengthen itself using energy from the Hamon Gauge. The fuller your Hamon Gauge, the quicker your cooldown times will recover.
Jonathan dislocates his joints to extend the range of his punch. When Hamon-strengthened, it activates quicker. It also deals more damage depending on how much Hamon you have stored.
After moving forward a bit, Jonathan releases a flurry of Hamon-strengthened punches, the last of which knocks his opponent back. When the attack begins, you can cancel out into other skills. When Hamon-strengthened, it receives activation speed, hit count, and damage boosts. It also deals more damage depending on how much Hamon you have stored.
Jonathan punches the ground and spreads his Hamon out over a wide area. If his Hamon hits an opponent, it will deal damage and paralyze them. When Hamon-strengthened, it receives an activation speed and attack boost, and the area of effect is increased. It deals additional damage depending on how much Hamon you have stored. The EX version of this attack makes Jonathan invincible when it's first used. It also makes his Hamon unblockable, further boosts attack, and lowers the recovery time after the move finishes. These are in addition to all of the usual Hamon-strengthened boosts. The Hamon also lasts for a longer amount of time, serving as a trap over the area of effect. When the EX version is Hamon-strengthened, it deals even more damage depending on how much Hamon you have stored.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Jonathan charges forward. If he hits an opponent, he will slam a large amount of Hamon forward, knocking them back. When Hamon-strengthened, this attack activates quicker, makes Jonathan invincible when it begins, and boosts both the distance and speed of his charge. It also gets an attack boost, and an additional damage boost depending on how much Hamon you have stored. The EX version activates even quicker than when Hamon-strengthened and makes Jonathan invincible while he is charging, in addition to further boosting the distance and speed of his charge. When the EX version is Hamon-strengthened, it boosts attack even more.
When Jonathan's health reaches zero and his partner is still alive, he can come back to life once per battle. This will give him one additional health gauge, which slowly depletes over time. He will not be able to use combos, skills, DHAs, or several other actions, but he can release an unblockable final Hamon burst with a Normal Attack. He will be retired when his health once again reaches zero, or when his final attack hits the opponent.
A flurry of Hamon-laced punches. The last strike knocks the opponent back.
A Hamon combo DHA that can be activated when Jonathan is paired up with Zeppeli.

An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Zeppeli charges forward. If he hits an opponent, he will slam a large amount of Hamon forward, knocking them back. When Hamon-strengthened, both the speed and distance of his charge increase. This skill also gets a damage boost depending on how much Hamon you have stored. The EX version makes Zeppeli invincible while he is charging, and the attack he launches after his charge will make the enemy fall to their knees and collapse.
Allows you to charge through other characters. The following is possible while charging: DHAs and various skills; "What a jump! From a seated position, using only his knees"; Flash Cancels; and Normal Attacks. It can also be canceled with a jump. When Hamon-strengthened, both the speed and distance of the charge increase.
A special jump. After jumping, press <icon btn_rr> to spin like a drill and fall down diagonally, launching into an additional Hamon attack. When used in mid-air, the additional attack happens automatically. It can be used on downed enemies, allowing Zeppeli to do a leg sweep when he lands that knocks the enemy back. When Hamon-strengthened, he becomes invincible during his jump, his movements speed up, and he performs more hits. In the EX version of this attack, press <icon btn_r2> to perform an additional mid-jump attack. Zeppeli will be invincible from the start of the attack until the moment he lands. Upon landing, he does a leg sweep and lifts his enemy up into the air. This move can be canceled in mid-jump with a mid-air Powerful or Normal Attack, and the brief pause that occurs during the leg sweep can be canceled with a jump.
Zeppeli shoots out a Hamon-laced disc of wine as a homing projectile. When Hamon-strengthened, he shoots out three with enhanced homing capabilities. The third disc knocks the enemy back.
A fast, high jump that launches Zeppeli straight up. It can be canceled mid-jump with any mid-air attack.
A massive Hamon punch attack. The final hit knocks the enemy down.

Dio absorbs health from his opponent and enters Vampiric Power-Up Mode. He becomes invincible for the complete duration of the skill, entering Vampiric Power-Up Mode when he finishes sucking blood. This can also be activated by canceling from a Powerful or Normal Attack. When in Vampiric Power-Up Mode, Dio's cooldown bar transforms into a timer until the mode wears off. When in this mode, the nature of Dio's skills change and various skills can be canceled into other skills. He can also use the special Vaporizing Freeze skill. Vampiric Power-Up Mode also gives him speed and cooldown recovery boosts.
Dio shoots fluid out from both of his eyes that sends any opponent spinning in mid-air. When in Vampiric Power-Up Mode, the firing speed and distance increase, and any opponent who gets hit will fall to their knees and collapse. The EX version gains the normal Vampiric Power-Up Mode boosts as well as an activation speed boost. Dio is also granted brief invincibility upon activation.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Dio charges forward. If he hits an opponent, he will absorb health from them and enter Vampiric Power-Up Mode. During this attack, rapidly press <icon btn_rl> to increase how much health you absorb. In Vampiric Power-Up Mode, the distance of his charge increases and the attack becomes unblockable. The EX version of this attack activates quicker, grants Dio brief invincibility upon activation, and provides an additional boost to the distance of his charge. It also allows Dio to absorb even more health, which can be further boosted by rapidly pressing <icon btn_r2>. This may also be canceled with other skills.
A combo of two knee kicks that can knock enemies back. After the attack, Dio automatically does a small jump, from which a mid-air Powerful or Normal Attack can be performed. The brief pause that occurs upon landing can be canceled with a jump. In Vampiric Power-Up Mode, Dio receives super armor from the beginning of the move until the attack animation finishes, and his short jump becomes quicker.
Dio performs a knee kick that can freeze opponents. In Vampiric Power-Up Mode, this move activates quicker.
Only available in Vampiric Power-Up Mode. This move can freeze the opponent; it activates when Dio guards just before an opponent's attack hits. However, it doesn't work against projectiles.

Part of the damage you receive becomes white damage. Hamon damage never becomes white, and simply deals more damage instead.

Use Hamon Breathing to charge the Hamon Gauge. Hold the button to continually charge it, which will strengthen your Normal Attacks, as well as some Powerful Attacks. When you activate a skill, it will automatically strengthen itself using energy from the Hamon Gauge. The fuller your Hamon Gauge, the quicker your cooldown times will recover.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Activates after the "Clacker Boomerang" skill. Joseph swings around his Hamon-laced clackers and performs a combo while moving forward. The final attack drops his opponent to the ground. The attack can be canceled by using any item with the "A Weapon with Overwhelming Advantages!" skill. When Hamon-strengthened, the attack deals more hits, and does more damage depending on how much Hamon you have stored. The EX version gains an activation speed and guard break boost.
This gives Joseph a special Hamon guard that prevents him from taking guard damage, even when hit by an opponent's skill. It also allows him to deflect projectiles when blocking from the front. Holding the button down will prolong this special guard state. Joseph's Stamina Gauge slowly drains while this skill is active. The guard deactivates when his Stamina Gauge reaches zero, or when the button is released. When Hamon-strengthened, it widens the angles from which Joseph can deflect a projectile.
A special dash. When locked-on to an opponent, Joseph will briefly run in the exact opposite direction from that opponent. When not locked-on, he will run forward for a bit. Joseph is briefly invincible at the beginning of the dash; the end of the dash can be canceled into other skills and Normal Attacks. When Hamon-strengthened, the invincibility period and dash distance increase. This also allows the end of the dash to be canceled into any kind of action.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Joseph throws a Hamon-laced clacker as a projectile. After the clacker flies a set distance, it automatically returns to his hand. When Hamon-strengthened, it gains increased range and homing capabilities, in addition to dealing more hits. It also deals more damage depending on how much Hamon you have stored. The EX version provides an additional damage and guard break boost. Any opponent hit by the clacker will fall to their knees and collapse.

Shigechi surrounds himself with Harvests. Pressing <icon btn_r1> multiple times will increase the Harvest density level and enhance the overall move up to a maximum of three levels. The additional Harvests will be used up when the "I can get anything I want" and "I poured it right into your veins!" skills are activated.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Shigechi tosses Harvests as projectiles that will latch on to and damage any opponent who gets hit. The higher the Harvest density level when the skill is activated, the easier it is for them to latch on. Based on how many are attached to an opponent, the opponent might become Poisoned, Sealed, or slow down. More effects will be added when more Harvests attach themselves. The EX version activates quicker and always deals the worst status effects regardless of how many Harvests are present. It also does not consume Harvests.
Shigechi releases his Harvests and has them bring objects back to him. The objects and effects will differ based on the Harvest density level. Levels 0-1 will drop projectiles on opponents from above. These projectiles are unblockable at density level 1. When locked-on, the Harvests will drop the projectiles on the target's head. When not locked-on, they'll drop the projectiles on the nearest opponent. At Harvest density level 2, Shigechi will be healed. At Harvest density level 3, Harvest's Dual Heat Gauge will be restored and he will earn JoJo Points. The EX version drops large projectiles on opponents from above, regardless of the Harvest density level. These projectiles are unblockable and do not consume Harvests. After the skill is activated, Shigechi gains super armor for the latter portion of the animation.
The time that Shigechi needs to wait for his Harvests refill will be greatly shortened. After the skill deactivates, the time he needs to wait until his Harvests refill will be greatly extended.
When Shigechi has a Harvest density level of 2 or above, he will be able to climb on special walls and pillars within the stage. The higher the Harvest density level, the faster he'll climb. Hold <icon btn_ru> to keep climbing. While climbing, press <icon btn_rl> or <icon btn_ru> to perform mid-air attacks, or press <icon btn_rd> to jump.
Shigechi assaults an opponent with a swarm of Harvests. The last strike knocks the opponent back.
The icon that displays the number of Harvests that can be added with the "Harvest" Style. Shigechi can possess a stock of up to 7 Harvests. When additional Harvests are consumed, it won't consume his stock as well. Shigechi gains additional Harvest stock one by one, over time. When he runs out of Harvest stock, he won't be able to add Harvest until his stock is restored.

Deactivate Golden Wind Requiem.
Giorno stabs the arrow into his chest. After a certain amount of time his Stand transforms into Golden Wind Requiem, however it will be canceled if he gets attacked during the animation. The animation can also be canceled at will with a DHA or Flash Cancel. Golden Wind Requiem only stays active for a set period of time, but from the second time onward, the transformation is quicker.
Giorno extends a tree branch from where he's standing and rides upwards on it. He is briefly invincible upon activation; when the tree starts extending, the move can be canceled into any other action. The tree will disappear some time after it finishes growing.
Giorno sticks a frog on his chest temporarily. When an opponent's attack hits him from the front, the attack's damage will automatically be reflected back to the opponent. It will only nullify projectiles that come at Giorno from the front; it will not work on DHAs. While this is active, Giorno cannot use Normal Attacks, knockback attacks, or takedowns. Once it reflects one attack, it will be deactivated. While active, Giorno's Stamina Gauge will gradually drain. When it reaches zero, the skill will deactivate. It will also be deactivated if Giorno uses a DHA, another skill, or the "Golden Wind Requiem!" Style.
Giorno changes his brooch into a piece of himself and merges it with his body in order to restore health. If he gets attacked while he does so, he won't recover any health.

It also grants Giorno invincibility until the attack begins.
Golden Wind creates a spherical force field. If any opponent touches it, their attack will be nullified. It will also nullify all projectiles. Giorno can activate this skill when he's being hit by any attack other than a DHA or a Dual Combo Finish. When he activates this skill, he also cures himself of any status ailments. The force field is unblockable and will hit even invincible opponents. It can be canceled into other skills.

Bucciarati installs a zipper in the ground. He can set up to four. Each one will remain for a period of time, acting as a paralyzing trap. Trapped opponents can quickly move the Left Stick to reduce the paralysis time.
Bucciarati can use the "Open, zipper!" Style to come out from one of the zippers he installed. If he has set no zippers, he'll appear from the same spot. Use the Left Stick while holding down the button to select a point. If you fail to select one, Bucciarati will move to the closest point. When several points are lined up in a straight line, he will move to the closest point. Bucciarati is invincible when he enters and exits from the zipper. After he exits from the zipper, he can cancel into the "Close, zipper!" skill.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Zipper Man charges and performs a punch combo. If activated in mid-air, it simply performs the combo without charging. The last strike knocks the opponent back.

The EX version grants Bucciarati brief invincibility upon activation and gives him super armor during the combo. It also lands more hits.
Bucciarati sends a zipper along the ground as a homing projectile. If it hits, Zipper Man's arm will pass through it and hit the opponent upward into the air. The EX version increases the projectile speed and homing capabilities. It also grants Bucciarati super armor from activation until the start of the attack.
Zipper Man uses a zipper to perform a long-distance punch. Hold the button down to delay the attack and extend the reach even further. If it hits, it will pull the opponent inward. The opening afterwards can be canceled into any other action.
Bucciarati grabs a zipper and travels at high speed. Hold the button to travel farther. Bucciarati can deal damage while moving, but moving depletes stamina. When his Stamina Gauge reaches zero, he stops moving. He can instantly activate the "I'll finish you from afar" Style while in motion and instantly change direction with <icon btn_r2>. When locked-on, he will turn to face his target. When not locked-on, he will turn to face the nearest enemy. He can cancel into a DHA or Flash Cancel when in motion, or upon stopping.
Bucciarati will revive once per battle after his health reaches zero. After reviving, he recovers some health and gains super armor during skill activations, Powerful Attacks, initial Normal Attacks, and Homing Dash Attacks. He will also gain super armor when placing zippers with the "Open, zipper!" Style, performing forward Sidesteps, and Homing Dashes.

If he tries to fire a shot when his pistol chamber is empty, he'll be forced to reload there. The EX version automatically reloads when firing and grants Mista super armor from activation to the middle of the shot.
This automatically activates if Mista gets attacked while loading or quick reloading. For a period of time, the maximum amount of bullets in the chamber will drop down to four, and Mista will take more damage than usual.

Diavolo activates Fast Forward Mode for a period of time. This makes him completely invisible to other characters, and invincible to all attacks except for those performed by Golden Wind Requiem. When activated, this skill depletes the Stamina Gauge. You can hold the button to extend this mode, but doing so will deplete stamina further. The mode will be deactivated if any of the following things happen: Diavolo's Stamina Gauge reaches zero; the button is released; Diavolo performs an attack or a Dual Combo request; Diavolo activates an Inherited Will or a Dual Combo; another character stops time; Diavolo's partner connects with a DHA; or when Diavolo gets knocked out.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Emperor Crimson instantly charges forward and punches, knocking an opponent back. Hold the button to make the attack unblockable and add charge distance and homing capabilities. Any opponent who gets hit will fall to their knees and collapse. The EX version activates with all the benefits of holding the button as long as possible and grants invincibility while charging.
If Emperor Crimson's hand slice hits, it will begin a punch combo. Diavolo becomes invincible from activation to the point where the attack begins. This is unblockable, and will knock back any opponent it hits. The EX version activates quicker and makes Diavolo invincible from the activation to the point where he stops dealing damage. It also makes Emperor Crimson move forward a bit more and increases its reach.
This activates only when Diavolo takes damage on the ground, upon which he will counterattack and knock the opponent back. This only activates when he bends back or gets caught in a combo.
This puts Diavolo in a special mode where he will automatically counter any opponent's attack. This does not activate against DHAs or other special attacks, however. Diavolo's counter will differ depending on his distance from the opponent; he can either step forward or teleport behind the opponent. Once he performs a counter this mode will be deactivated. When this mode is active, it will gradually drain his Stamina Gauge, deactivating when he runs out of stamina.
When Diavolo Sidesteps in any direction, he can make himself completely invisible and invincible for a moment.
Emperor Crimson fast forwards time. The last strike knocks the opponent back.

Jolyne extends string and then uses it to travel at high speed. Hold down the button to extend the string out farther. When locked-on, she will extend the string toward the target. If the string hits the target, it paralyzes them and moves Jolyne toward them. When not locked-on, the string will not hit an opponent. Instead, Jolyne will move wherever the player chooses. When on the ground she will extend the string diagonally upwards to the rear, then pull herself up to the point where the string ends. While in mid-air she will extend the string diagonally downwards in front of her, then move to the point where the string ends. If the string hits a part of the stage, the string will stop extending and Jolyne will start moving. Jolyne is invincible while in motion.
Jolyne creates a string barrier around herself. If an opponent touches the barrier, it will paralyze them and do damage, then remain there for a period of time as a trap. When the opponent touches it, Jolyne also takes white damage. The EX version activates quicker.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Stone Ocean extends its arms with string and performs a combo punch. The last strike knocks the opponent back. Damage will differ depending on the range. The EX version activates quicker and the punch combo can be canceled into a Sidestep.
Stone Ocean does a somersault and extends string that paralyzes the opponent. Then, it performs a punch combo and slams the opponent onto the ground. Jolyne is granted brief invincibility upon activation.
Jolyne turns an area of her body into a Möbius strip in order to lessen the damage she receives. However, it won't work against projectiles, DHAs, and certain skills. When the Möbius is present, Full Moon's attacks will not be able to turn Jolyne inside out, and it can turn her back to normal if she activates it when she's already been turned inside out. This cannot be activated when the "You have the Ghost Lighter, don't you!?" skill is active. Likewise, activating that skill will deactivate the Möbius strip.
This can be activated once per battle, at will, whenever Jolyne has less than one bar of health left. Jolyne uses a lighter to set herself on fire, entering Burning Mode. In this mode, the fire on Jolyne's body deals severe damage to her and drops her defense, but it strengthens all her attacks aside from projectiles and DHAs. She also gains super armor when she's attacking. Any opponent she hits will be set on fire as well.

Hermes puts stickers on her arms and legs to multiply them and boost the hit counts for her various attacks. If she activates this when no stickers are present, she'll use stickers to multiply her arms. If she activates this when she already has stickers on her arms, she'll use stickers to multiply her legs. If she recoils from any damage, all the stickers fall off and she'll take damage equal to how many stickers were present.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Smack releases a flurry of punches. Press <icon btn_rl> to chain it into a kick combo and then a backfist strike. Using this in conjunction with the "Here's where ya stick it!" Style will increase the hit count. The EX version does more damage and shortens the opening after the backfist.

Ermes stabs a stickered lance projectile into the ground. If there's already a lance in the ground she removes the sticker from the cloned lance, causing it to combine back to the original. If the lance hits an opponent, it will do damage and draw the opponent toward the sticker-free lance. If it draws the opponent all the way back to the sticker-free lance, it will do more damage and make the opponent fall to their knees and collapse.
Smack puts a sticker on a lance and throws it as a projectile. If it hits an opponent, it will stab into them and knock them back. If an opponent already has a lance stabbed in them, the skill will change. Ermes will remove the sticker from the cloned lance, which will turn it into a high-speed projectile that carries Ermes toward the original. Once they reach the target, the lance will do damage and make the opponent fall to their knees. The EX version boosts the tossed lance's speed and attack. It also gives Ermes super armor during the high-speed travel.
Ermes uses a sticker to multiply her hands and performs a punch combo. The last strike knocks the opponent back.

Diver Drive performs a combo of kicks that will knock an opponent back. This attack can send trap-like shocks into walls and opponents. Affected walls will knock back any opponent who approaches, while affected opponents will knock themselves and their partner back. Hold the button down to make the traps unblockable and land more hits. Up to three traps can be set at once, and will remain for a period of time.

Hold down the button to send Diver Drive into your partner for a period of time, provided they are in range. While Diver Drive is inside them, Anastasia will not be able to perform any actions that require his Stand. If any opponent's attack—other than a projectile—hits Anastasia's partner, Anastasia absorbs part of the damage as white damage and Diver Drive automatically counterattacks. This will be deactivated when Anastasia's partner gets out of range, or when a DHA, Dual Combo Finish, or Flash Burst is activated. When Anastasia sends Diver Drive inside himself, he can deactivate it at will using the same command.

When locked-on, Diver Drive gains homing capabilities and can be directed by moving the Left Stick to the left or right. Diver Drive can do damage while moving, but uses up stamina. It will stop moving when Anastasia's Stamina Gauge reaches zero. This move can be canceled into a jump only when stopped. The EX version makes Anastasia invincible to projectiles while moving and knocks back any opponent he hits. It can be canceled into any skill, Style, or Normal Attack.

The skill's range is also widened, and lasts for a longer period of time.
Pucchi jumps inside a metal frame and begins floating upwards. After a period of time, his Stand will transform into Maiden Heaven.

An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Weather creates a hurricane projectile at his feet and sends it toward an opponent within range. If it hits the opponent, it will send them spinning upward. The EX version activates quicker and lands more hits.
Weather sprays out blood and creates several blood puddles on the ground. If an opponent touches one, a spear of blood will stab them. The puddles will remain in place as traps for a period of time. The EX version increases the number of puddles and gives Weather super armor upon activation.
Weather creates white clouds around his partner that last for a period of time. He can only activate this skill when his partner is in range. When this skill is active, they will deflect certain projectiles and deal damage to opponents who attack within range of his partner, in addition to setting them on fire. When Weather's partner gets knocked into a wall, they automatically turn neutral. They will deactivate when Weather activates a DHA, or gets hit by a DHA or other special attack.
Weather creates a rainbow that will turn any opponent it touches into a snail. If another opponent touches a snail, they will also turn into a snail. This attack is unblockable and opponents who become snails can do nothing but move at a slow pace. When this skill activates, the cooldown bar will change into a timer. This skill will deactivate either when the timer reaches zero, or when Weather gets hit by a DHA. Some characters cannot be turned into snails: Wamuu, when "Now I will shut out the light, and with this horn see only the wind!" is active; N'doul; and Pucchi.

In Ground Mode, Johnny gets off his horse and the nature of his actions and skills change. However, he cannot stand up or use other actions.
In Mounted Mode, he rides his horse and the nature of his actions and skills change. He can't interact with any objects while in Mounted Mode. Staying in this mode gradually drains his stamina. When his Stamina Gauge reaches zero, he will switch back over to Ground Mode.
Switch between Mounted Mode and Ground Mode. In Ground Mode, Johnny can cancel out of a Normal Attack, Knockback Attack, or Takedown Attack into this, but it will consume stamina.
Johnny uses nail power to perform a special jump in whichever direction the Left Stick is tilted. Johnny can do damage just before he jumps, and gets super armor from the time of activation until the beginning of the attack. The attack right before the jump can be canceled into a DHA. The jump itself can be canceled into a mid-air Normal Attack. In Mounted Mode, he jumps from his saddle.
Johnny fires a Golden Spin nail bullet toward the ground, into a hole he creates. This "hole projectile" can knock an opponent up into the air from below and Johnny can perform additional attacks on them once they land. The "hole projectile" has homing capabilities and can travel across the ground and walls for a period of time. This skill requires one nail bullet to use. While in Mounted Mode, its homing capabilities weaken, but it moves faster. The EX version does not require a nail bullet to use and can be activated even when Johnny has no nail bullets left. He also gains super armor from the time of activation until the attack begins.
Johnny passes his arm through a hole and makes it appear elsewhere before firing a nail bullet projectile. The hole has homing capabilities and can travel across the ground and walls. Hold the button down to move the hole, then either release the button or wait until time runs out, at which point Johnny's arm will appear. His arm will then point toward the opponent and fire a Golden Spin nail bullet, making the opponent fall to their knees and collapse. When locked-on, the nail bullet will be fired toward the target. When not locked-on, he'll fire a nail bullet toward the nearest enemy. In Mounted Mode, the hole's homing capabilities weaken, but it moves faster. It takes two nail bullets to use, and cannot be used when Johnny only has one nail bullet left.
Johnny uses a hole to make Tusk Act 4 appear at an opponent's feet when they're in range. When locked-on, Tusk will appear at the target's feet. When not locked-on, Tusk will appear at the nearest opponent's feet. Tusk does damage when it appears and will launch into a combo if its unblockable hit connects. Johnny can perform additional attacks once the opponent is grounded. This requires one nail bullet to use. The EX version does not require any nail bullets, and can be used even when Johnny has no nail bullets left. It makes Tusk appear instantly at the opponent's feet, and gives Johnny super armor from the time of activation until the attack begins.
The icon that displays how many nail bullets are left. Ten are displayed for both hands, and they refill one by one over time. The special "Care for some herbal tea?" skill boosts their recovery speed. When a DHA or Dual Combo is activated, they get completely restored.
Johnny pulls out herbal tea and drinks it. This boosts his nail bullet recovery speed for a period of time. It can be canceled into a DHA.
Tusk Act 4 performs a combo. The last strike knocks the opponent back.

Gyro spins both balls and charges his Spin Gauge. This cannot be used unless Gyro is holding both balls. Hold the button down to keep charging it. In Mounted Mode, the Spin Gauge will charge faster. When the Spin Gauge gets full, Golden Spin Mode will be activated. When Golden Spin Mode is active, Gyro's actions and skills become enhanced. After Gyro enters this mode and some time passes, his Spin Gauge will slowly start to deplete. When it reaches zero, Golden Spin Mode will be deactivated.
In Ground Mode, he gets off his horse and the nature of his actions and skills change.
In Mounted Mode, he rides his horse and the nature of his actions and skills change. He can't interact with any objects while in Mounted Mode. Staying in this mode gradually drains his stamina. When his Stamina Gauge reaches zero, he will switch back over to Ground Mode.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Gyro throws a Steel Ball. When Golden Spin Mode is active, this attack deals more hits and gets a boost to both guard break power and range. The opening created after the move also gets shortened, cooldown recovery speed is boosted, and Gyro becomes able to cancel out into various skills. In Mounted Mode, he can throw a Steel Ball toward an opponent while galloping. When the "Scan" skill is active, he can throw one Steel Ball toward another Steel Ball in flight. The Steel Ball that bounces back will become capable of breaking an opponent's guard in one hit, knocking them back. When Golden Spin Mode is active, the Steel Ball that bounces back will land more hits and send opponents spinning into the air.
Gyro rolls a Steel Ball on the ground and creates a tornado projectile. If it hits an opponent, it will send them spinning into the air. Hold down the button to keep spinning the Steel Ball at a set speed. When locked-on, the tornado will gain homing capabilities. When Golden Spin Mode is active, the tornado will receive speed, homing, and damage boosts; travel farther; and attack over a wider range. The opening created after the move will be shortened and cooldown recovery speed will be boosted. In Mounted Mode, the tornado will move slower. The EX version grants Gyro brief invincibility upon activation and gives the tornado all the boosts that it receives in Golden Spin Mode.
Gyro creates an air lens by spinning his Steel Balls, making himself invincible to projectiles and traps. This also makes it impossible for anyone to lock-on to Gyro and prevents his target cursor from appearing. When it activates, the cooldown bar changes into a timer. The skill will deactivate when the timer reaches zero. When Golden Spin Mode is active, the skill will last for a longer amount of time and the cooldown recovery speed will be boosted.
Switch between Mounted Mode and Ground Mode. When Golden Spin Mode is active, the switching happens faster, and Gyro gains super armor through the middle of the switching animation. It also boosts his cooldown recovery speed.
An EX-only skill. Gyro throws one Steel Ball diagonally upwards as an unblockable projectile. When locked-on, this will fly toward his target. Gyro becomes invincible from activation to the moment he throws the ball, which remains in the air as a trap for a period of time. Hold the button down to extend the distance of the throw, then release the button to lock the ball in place. The ball is unblockable and will make any opponent fall to their knees and collapse. When another attack hits the Steel Ball, it will be deflected. When locked-on, it will be deflected toward the target. When not locked-on, it will be deflected toward the nearest opponent. When Golden Spin Mode is active, the ball gets an attack boost and the cooldown recovery speed will also increase.
Gyro throws his second Steel Ball and knocks the opponent back. When Golden Spin Mode is active, it lands more hits and gains boosts to guard break power, range, and cooldown recovery speed. Additionally, the opening created after the move is shortened. When the "Scan" skill is active, it cannot be used. In Mounted Mode, he can throw a Steel Ball toward an opponent while galloping.
This gauge allows Gyro to charge up his "Spin" style.
This icon displays the status of Gyro's two Steel Balls. If he tosses out a steel ball, its icon will go dark, and light up again when it returns to his hand. When Gyro is in Golden Spin Mode, the icon will start glowing.
Gyro rides his horse and throws his Steel Balls, which will knock the opponent back a great distance.
A DHA that can be performed when Gyro is partnered up with Johnny. It begins with the Golden Spin, then Ball Breaker and Tusk Act 4 team up for a combo.

Valentine slips into a parallel dimension and then teleports behind the opponent. He is invincible from the time he disappears to the time when he reappears, and gains super armor when he reappears. He can cancel out into various skills, a Style, or a Normal Attack as he reappears. When locked-on, he'll appear behind the opponent's back. When not locked-on, he'll disappear and reappear in the same spot.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. D4C charges forward and performs a hand slice combo that will knock the opponent back. If the opponent hits a wall, pressing <icon btn_rl> will perform an additional attack. The final strike knocks the opponent into the air. While following the opponent to perform an additional attack, Valentine becomes invincible. The EX version makes him invincible from the time of activation until the point where the attack begins.
Valentine pulls out a gun and fires six bullet projectiles.
Valentine brings in another Valentine from a parallel dimension. This Valentine moves on his own, and the original cannot use certain actions while he's present. When his health reaches zero, Valentine activates a DHA, or a certain amount of time passes, the parallel dimension Valentine disappears. The EX version makes Valentine invincible while this skill is active.
Valentine switches out with another Valentine from a parallel world and restores his health to full. Every time he activates this skill, his defense gets lowered.
This activates automatically when Valentine gets down to one bar of health or lower. He becomes invincible while this skill is active. Light pillars will shine out from the ground around him, making him invincible to projectiles. However, he can still be hit when attacking, or when Tusk Act 4 fires a projectile. The light pillars also have their own durability. When projectile damage drops it to zero, the light will disappear for a period of time, then regenerate.
Valentine takes an opponent into a parallel dimension and brings them in contact with another version of themselves, canceling them out and knocking them back.
This icon displays that status of the other Valentine. When Valentine brings in another version of himself with the "This is another me..." skill, it will light up. When that Valentine disappears, the icon will go dark.

In Mounted Mode, he rides his horse and the nature of his actions and skills change. He can't interact with any objects while in Mounted Mode. Staying in this mode gradually drains his stamina. When his Stamina Gauge reaches zero, he will switch back over to Ground Mode.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Diego throws a gasoline can as a projectile, splashing gasoline around. If it hits an opponent they'll become Gasolined, which prevents them from blocking any fire-based attacks. Any fire-based attacks that hit them will make them explode and send them spinning into the air. The gasoline also remains where it fell as a trap that detonates fire-based attacks. The gasoline can also be used to perform further attacks on grounded opponents. In Mounted Mode, the gasoline can is thrown differently. It can be canceled into the "This is where the fun begins..." skill. When time is stopped, the gasoline can will fly for a distance, stop in mid-air, and continue flying once time starts moving again. The EX version activates quicker and grants Diego invincibility from the time of activation to the time the attack begins.
Diego tosses a bunch of flaming matches as projectiles. If they hit an opponent, they will deal damage and set them on fire. When time is stopped, they will travel for a distance, stop in mid-air, and continue flying once time has started moving again.
Diego sets barb wire in front of him. It will hit and paralyze any opponent who touches it, remaining there as a trap for a period of time. The EX version activates quicker and gives the trap higher range.
Switch between Mounted Mode and Ground Mode. This cannot be used while time is stopped.
Diego stops time and throws a ton of knives into the air. Then time starts moving again and the knives stab into an opponent, sending them flying.
In Ground Mode, he gets off his horse and the nature of his actions and skills change.
I can steal your vision.
Checkmate!
The hell is your problem?!
I'll suck all the moisture out of you...!
Let me take that from you.
EX The hell is your problem?!

Josuke throws out a bubble projectile that will steal an opponent's vision. If it hits, the opponent will become Blinded for a period of time. However, it will only deal damage to N'doul, or Wamuu when his "Now I will shut out the light, and with this horn see only the wind!" Style is active. When an opponent is Blinded, they cannot lock-on, and the target cursor will not appear. They also become easier to guard break and are rendered unable to use various skills and Styles. If a Blinded opponent activates a DHA or Dual Combo, or Josuke gets hit by a DHA or certain attacks, the effect will be lifted.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Soft & Wet performs a punch combo aimed directly below. The last strike traps the opponent inside a bubble and temporarily paralyzes them. The opponent can quickly move the Left Stick to shorten the paralysis time. If the opponent recoils from damage during the paralysis, they will be freed. Josuke can also perform additional attacks on the opponent while they're grounded.
After Josuke performs a backstep, Soft & Wet charges forward and performs a punch combo. The last strike knocks the opponent back. Josuke gains super armor from the time of activation to the middle of the backstep. The EX version activates quicker and grants Josuke invincibility from activation to the middle of the backstep. It also boosts the charge distance and hit count while allowing him to cancel from the punch combo into a Sidestep. The last strike will send the opponent spinning into the air, and the opening after the move will be shortened.
Josuke creates a huge bubble. If an enemy touches the bubble, it will deal damage and drain their Stamina Gauge, then remain there for a period of time as a trap. The EX version activates quicker and grants Josuke invincibility from the time of activation to the time the attack starts. It also lands more hits.
Josuke sends out up to two homing bubble projectiles.
Josuke performs a combo on an opponent from whom he stole friction. The final strike sends the opponent sliding along the ground.
A DHA that can be performed when Josuke is partnered up with Joshu Higashikata. Josuke uses Soft & Wet to steal friction from the ground and then slides Joshu into the enemy.
What a stupid thing to say.
Whoa! I did that!

I did it! Me! Ahahahahaha!

Joshu irritates any opponents in range and forces them to lock-on to him. They will also go flying straight toward him. When opponents are successfully affected by this attack, his Dual Heat Gauge will be restored.
An Easy Beat-compatible skill. Joshu temporarily puts opponents in a state of panic. The last strike knocks the opponent back. While Panicked, opponents cannot guard or use skills. If the opponent activates a DHA or Dual Combo, or Joshu gets hit by a DHA or certain attacks, the effect will be deactivated.
Joshu deals damage to an opponent with screws and paralyzes them. If the opponent quickly moves the Left Stick, they can shorten the paralysis time. The EX version activates quicker and grants Joshu invincibility from the time of activation to the time the attack begins. It also makes Nuts N. Bolts move forward a bit more, extends its reach, and boosts attack.
Joshu starts running around automatically. When this activates, his cooldown bar changes into a timer. If he keeps running around until it reaches zero, he'll get boosts to both attack and Dual Heat Gauge recovery speed. It will also restore his Flash Cancel Icon, Flash Burst Icon, and cooldown times. If he performs an action while running, the timer will slow down. He can't interact with any objects. If he recoils from damage, blocks an attack, or activates a DHA or Dual Combo, this skill will deactivate. The EX version will make the timer deplete faster and prevents it from slowing down if Joshu performs an action while running. It also makes him run faster.
Joshu uses screws to take the opponent's body apart, which makes them collapse to the ground.
A DHA that can be performed when Joshu is partnered up with Josuke Higashikata 8. Josuke uses Soft & Wet to steal friction from the ground and then slides Joshu into the enemy.

How dare you! I'll never allow it!
I feel a strange sort of kinship with you...
Erina... Please, be happy...
I'll knock you until you cry like a little girl!
Trembling heart! Unrelenting heat! Engrave the beat of my blood!
I'll cleanse the world of your filth!
I will protect my father and the Joestar family!
I won't cry over burying you!
I'll bear any pain! I'll endure any trials!
You must be annihilated, Dio!
I guess that we were one and the same.
As Zeppeli said: "Think like the enemy!"
Also: "Own your fear, and your breathing will calm!"
Don't think you've won! You've made a fatal error!
Evil blood flows in you!
Your soul doesn't burn with the same fire as mine!
I'll always be here for you.
Humans can do anything as long as they have faith! We can evolve too! You'll see!
I can't believe I have to kill in order to save my soul!
You're not worthy of even uttering my noble name!
I...can't channel any Hamon...
Hey, baby! Don't tell me you're gonna fight in a risky place like that? Come on down!
Bastard! How many lives have you sucked away to heal those wounds?!
The ode to humanity is an ode to courage! Courage is humanity's very lifeblood!
Silence!
The evil—I can feel it! It's overwhelming! We've got an evil tyrant on our hands!
A flea that stands up to a massive opponent... Would you be able to call that "courage"?
This is Sendo!
Ultimate Deep Pass Overdrive!
This is my last wish, JoJo! You must fulfill it!
Popow, pow pow!
This is the sound of a successful Overdrive!
I am satisfied with my fate in life...
I feel like I gained both a best friend and a son at the same time.
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!
You did well to survive! But the "Stone Mask Man" lives as well!
Sendo and the Stone Mask are two sides of the same coin.
This guy reeks! He smells worse than vomit!
I'm the meddlesome Speedwagon!
Speedwagon withdraws coolly.
Don't try to bluff, you rich little snot!
Destiny, huh? Yeah, maybe who we meet in this world is all up to destiny...
Right now, he's completely alone! He's got no one to support him! I know I'm not the right man for the job, but I want give him something, even if it's just a little... A tiny bit of hope that'll let him go on living!!
I'm always on the sidelines... I can't do anything! Not a single thing!
It's all over now. We'll take this to our graves.
Now this is something to celebrate! You two had better find happiness together!
I'll back you up whenever you need me, and travel to the ends of the earth to aid you! But maybe I'd only be holding you back?
I thought you said losing four fingers would be nothing to you! Well?
He's been evil since the day he was born!
I've come this far! I'd have be heartless to just stand by and watch this, and that's not the kind of man I am!
That sound—the blade's hit bone! You took that head-on!!
Yeah! Bring it on, don't hold back! Let's see you go all-out!
Can I learn that Hamon thing too? I wanna try it out! Teach it to me! C'mon, I'm begging you!
Just knowing that he's still alive and well casts a black shadow over my heart, and makes me sweat like mad!
You can thank me once we've survived this battle...
If anyone lays a finger on that gentleman, they're gonna have to deal with Speedwagon!
I steal things, but he steals lives!!
Do you remember how many breads you have eaten in your life?
Weak, WEAK!!
Booze! I can't get enough!
You think you can defeat me with those slowpoke moves?!
You vile fool!
Frozen in your tracks!
If there truly exists a god that controls our fate, then having us meet up was one of his best plans yet!
I reject my humanity, JoJo!! I'm going to surpass the human race!
A cruel death awaits you!
And so, my friend's body becomes my future!
Fouler than a frog's piss!
Every last one of you will feed my undead!
I welcome you, my eternal flesh and blood!
I can even make history itself my slave!
You should have followed through...
How dare you...How dare you cut my precious face?!
I, Dio, admit that your spirit has explosive power!!
I could make you immortal too, you know!
I'll feast upon your pathetic visage!
All your hopes have collapsed into thin air!
Caesaaaaaar!
"It can't be...! JoJo!?" ...is what you'll say in shock!
Guess I did it again!
Damn meased to pleet ya!
Ain't nothing the trickster loves more than a trick!
Run, Smokey! Outta my way you rubberneckers!
This means war!
Oh no! If there's one word I hate, it's "working," and if there's another, it's "hard!"
I don't know why myself, but I gotta respect you.
Oh, crap! I'm gonna get lectured by granny Erina!
Um, err...well, you see, I, er...gave him that wallet. Yeah, that's right, Officer.
OH NO ZURA!
There anything besides air in that head of yours?
I'm a lot meaner than most people, you know!
Dammit Kars, just how rotten are you?!
Cross my arms like this, close my eyes, and grin! Instant victory smile!
I'll listen to your stupid comments after you've experienced the true beauty of Clacker Volley!
Guess all I have left now is my specialty...escape! All I can do now is run!
Knock knock! Anyone home?
Your next line will be: "How did you know about the brass knuckles, you ass?!"
Th-that was my very last Hamon... I'm all out!
Your defeat will be cold and cruel!
The last thing you'll see is the Zeppeli spirit, which will forever be passed down from one generation to the next! The spirit of humanity!
JoJo... this is my last ounce of Hamon! Take it!
Mamma mia! Okay, okay, I'm-a going!
You couldn't even beat that girl!
Gotta handle this! I won't stop until I do!
Gonna beat your ass back to the boonies!
You're a film! A photographic film!
Come, signorina, let me undo that Hamon spell for you.
Right now, my mind is back in the slums!
Let's throw down, you stupid hick!
Some of my bubbles can cleave even the wind itself...
Here's a more practical version of my grandpa's Hamon Cutter...
I'll say it once more! You can't even beat that girl!
He's lost so much blood—his mind must be getting hazy, yet he performed a masterful bluff only a pro gambler could pull off!!
That guy's Hamon is too weak! He's useless!
If you want to reach your full potential in just one month, you'd better be prepared to die!
Just try and lay a hand on me. I'll make you pay for it with your life!
You picked a bad time to test me!
I'm going to make your ugly mug even uglier!
Using your own weaknesses to your advantage? How clever of you!
Yes! That's your best bet!
What am I to make of all this? My opponents get stranger by the day!
I haven't lived this long for nothing! I don't need sympathy from some teenager!
I'll bet the Red Stone on it!
We must win! A draw is as good as a loss!
The Red Stone dies with me.
JoJo. You are not allowed to mourn Caesar, nor are you allowed to go looking for him.
You're an expert at cheating! Not sure if I should praise you for that or not, though.
All I need is this scarf!
I need to carry out my own duty.
This scarf was woven from Sathiphorosia Scarab-thread, which can fully conduct Hamon energy.
This is no time for a drink!
German Science is the best in the world!
"Courage consists not in hazarding without fear; but being resolutely minded in a just cause." - The words of the ancient Greek historian, Plutarch.
It can fire 600 armor-piercing rounds per minute!
My body! It's the pride of the German people, and the prime example of our superior German Science!
You think there's a child alive who'd be afraid of a caged grizzly at a zoo? Well there isn't!
To me, he's nothing but a mangy caveman who's lived far too long!
Bwah, WA ha ha ha!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!!
I-I still can't beat him! My equipment... Modern human technology still isn't enough to defeat him!
German medicine and pharmaceuticals are the best in the world! They can do anything!
I'm going to turn your body into a one square centimeter block of meat, just like one would pluck a chicken!
What? Wh-what? WHAT?
Take this—new anti-vampire weaponry!
Ultraviolet Radiation Beam!
Kaaaars! I can't believe I get to put an end to you! What a delight!
Get a hold of yourself! German soldiers never falter!
This airplane will be your coffin!
A god... He's become a god! We humans...we can't beat a god! We have no choice but to obey!
"When the old start to kill themselves, it means their city is on the brink of ruin."
Only the strongest warriors matter. Friendship and respect belong to true warriors!
Perhaps I've been wandering all these millennia just to meet you here.
Wamuu!
I'm expecting a magnificently nice fight from you.
Fighting Technique: Holy Sandstorm!
Very well! You are deemed worthy to be killed by the great Wamuu!
That was my first truly satisfying battle in a while.
Get stronger! Maybe then you can defeat my Holy Sandstorm!
No regrets... I'm just glad I got to see how far you've progressed.
You are just as mesmerizing and fleeting as your bubbles!
Get stronger. Then you may come at Wamuu again...
It can't be... How...is this possible...
I don't need, eyes, words, or antennae. I can sense it...through movements alone!
Fearless eyes! Impertinent words! Yes, he is tough! Those minuscule guts of his are truly tough!
Why are you so stubborn? Have your brains rotted to mush?
I call it the Wedding Ring of Death. And I'm about to attach it to one of your coronary arteries!
You're gonna burn like a candle on a birthday cake!
I can't take it anymore!
Hamon?! Please, it's all about my Vascular Needle Attack!
I hit the nail on the head, didn't I? I'm exactly right...riiiiight?!
All's fair in love and war!
Gah hah hah hah! C'mon! Take me on!
Aah, that feels good...
Despair! Now let's hear the twisted cries of torment and pain!
Erratic Blaze King Cartwheel Prison Mode!
I said MOVE, damn you! If I so much as touch you, you can say goodbye to half your body!
All this talk is just you trying to come up with a plan, right?!
Hmm...so piercing... You look much fiercer now...
I'm going to send this boiling blood into your body and turn your face into a sputtering stew!
I...I lost?! To a mere human?!
Those who greet me with an attitude like yours don't live long!
If you insist on going after it, you'd better kill me first!
Victory is everything!
Win win win! Win win win~
There can be only one!
Will you keep it up? Think you can keep. It. Up?
You Hamon users like to fight fair, huh? Then let's settle this fair and square.
My Mode is Light... Shining Sabers!
Finally... finally... I've conquered the sun!
Feast your eyes on my Hamon!
You'll be melted before you hit the bottom of the ravine!
Let me show you... The Ultimate Life Form has no equal!
I cannot allow Esidisi's efforts to go to waste!!
Santviento? He was a green child—nothing more than a guard dog! We are on a far higher level!!
So merciless... You're beautiful, Wamuu! You will be the victor! Win this, and use those humans' lives to heal your wounds!!
I'll keep my promise! One-on-one! I never intended to break it...
You see, Kars doesn't let himself get excited. Achieving his goals is always his top priority!
And that radiance! Such beauty! It's more dazzling than anything I've ever seen...
Becoming the Ultimate Life Form means absorbing the abilities of every living thing... I contain all of existence!
Hmph! Do you think me FOOL enough to fight one-on-one!?
I've still got one strategy left: Escape!
If I were a gunslinger from an old Western, I'd say, "Draw! Let's see who's the faster one!"
Gimme a break.
You're getting an ass beating from yours truly.
Do you understand?
Next time we meet, I'm gonna land a thousand strikes on that face of yours.
Even a guy like me can smell the stench of evil from miles away!
You pissed me off.
Looks like I found myself another idiot.
I stopped time...
I couldn't forget a character like you even if I wanted to. Take care of yourself...
You're such a joke I can't even think of anything to say to you!
If you keep this up...you'll die.
Don't mess with me.
I'll make sure you get what's coming to you.
It's been a while since I've seen an orthodox Stand user who doesn't rely on strategy or techniques.
Good. This is a pretty interesting game...
I didn't call for you...
Wa ha ha ha ha!
Here's your receipt!
This is an evil spirit.
How does it feel to have someone stand behind you when you can't move?
Beating the living crap out of you and finishing you off here would only leave a bad aftertaste in my soul!
When Stand users smoke even a little tobacco, the blood vessels on the tip of their nose pop out.
DIO owes me something... And I aim to get what I'm owed.
It just does whatever it wants...meaning this creature is no longer fit to live on planet earth.
I've never met a Stand this tough before... My confidence might shatter first!
You're going to get even uglier now. Well, your face will, at least...
Humans are basically creatures who destroy so they may live, but you've got the gentlest ability of them all.
Once a life ends, it never comes back... No matter what kind of Stand it possessed.
Time for a little hunting...
Focus on staying calm before you worry about speed.
I can sense both viciousness and a cool demeanor within him.
If it weren't for you, I'd be dead right now.
That's a nice watch, but I'm going to break it so you can't tell time anymore...
You did well to fight this long on your own... I'm impressed.
I hate things that are a pain in the ass... So I'm just going to bust him up.
Go on, say something to him... Give him a snappy one-liner!
True observation means seeing with your mind, not your eyes...to listen with your heart, not your ears...
Granny Suzie Q's never been angrier in her entire 61 years of marriage...
Really getting through to someone is an amazing thing, but sometimes there's a little leftover mess. That mess is called resentment.
Gimme a...break.
This is just too heavy...
I've always cherished you...
Star Platinum The World!
I can stop time for a maximum of five seconds.
It's too short! Stopping time for five seconds isn't enough...
You're not making any sense... Are you insane?
The knives are already falling!! Pucchi already threw them into the air...just like DIO once did!!
I was one move...too late...!
Tch! Tch! Yes I am! Tch! Tch!
You really thought you could defeat a fortuneteller like me in a battle of prophecies? Not in a million years...
Give me four wishes instead!
Go on, laugh! A big, fat, belly-laugh. That'll get you through anything!
Crossfire Hurricane Special!
That flesh bud was born from DIO's cells, and now it's attached itself to the boy's brain.
Magician's Red won't stand for this. Too bad for you!
Always trying to play the knight, aren't you?!
I knew I had a right to be worried! Stop overestimating yourself, Jean Pierre!
Jean Pierre! Iggy! Look out!
I'm deeply grateful for the introduction...
My Stand is called Magician's Red precisely because it can manipulate flames as it pleases!
My first wish is to make you scream out in pain!
My second wish is to make you shriek in horror!
My third wish...is to make you cry tears of regret!
Hell! Right to you! That's HELL 2U!
This is VERY bad!
Now THIS is pure Mohammed Avdol! The perfect role for my character! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Incinerate them! Magician's Red!
It hurts to go up in flames, doesn't it? Use that dagger to commit suicide if you wish.
Rero rero rero rero rero!
Jotaro! What do you think? Let's hear it!
This...is a...message...for you... It's all...I could do...
I'll have you know that Noriaki Kakyoin doesn't fall for mind games!
Take this, DIO! 20m Radius Emerald Splash!!
This'll have to do for a handshake.
Ta-dah!
No more hesitation. Prepare yourself!
I'll never return to the pathetic Kakyoin that I used to be!
With all due respect, I know myself pretty well. And I'm nobody's fool.
My silent Stand, Hierophant Green, is perfectly capable of finishing him off.
When my Hierophant rips things apart, it writhes—in euphoria!"
I don't believe it... It happened so quickly... So easily...
My final...Emerald Splash...
Please, take this. And...tell them...
Ho ha ha ha heh heh heh ha ha!
Touch it, and it fires! Hierophant's Barrier!
I've got you surrounded within a 20 meter radius! You won't be able to hide a single movement from me now!
I bet my soul on it!
Just... What happened? Did he get me? I can't move...
Go on, puke all over the place!
There's no way you could forgive this guy, RIGHT?
You didn't need to shove me!
I just LOVE coconuts.
I'm kidding! Ha ha ha ha? Just kiddiiing!
Let me just explain things as they happened! I thought I was climbing up the stairs toward him, but then all of a sudden I was at the bottom again!
Très bien! TRÈS! BIEN!
There's no time to grieve.
I will banish you to the abyss of despair.
How about that swordplay? Impressed, non?
Oh how I've waited for this! You shall be skewered!
Bravo! Oh, bravo!
I've got the worst luck with friends.
Don't have the same reaction as me!!
I don't really understand it myself, but I truly have no idea what happened to me.
I'm not afraid at all. I am filled with fighting spirit!
Allow me to teach you my name. Pierre... Jean Pierre.
I wish I could press your heart over and over again, just like a shutter button!
Anything! Anything but that!! HEEEELP!!
I feel like I'm gonna go crazy... This isn't something petty like hypnosis or super speed...
Are you an idiot?
My Stand is the Chariot, the card that represents invasion and victory!
Naive, naive, naive, naive, naive!
I'll leave the rest up to the guy down below.
I'm fine, I'm OK! You saved me...merci beaucoup.
The arrow is neither friend nor enemy! What I'm about to explain now is our only hope!
If someone with power acquires this arrow, they'll gain the power to control the minds of every living creature in existence!
I can't exit from the turtle's gem, so I decided to live inside this turtle as a ghost for a while longer.
Put the arrow in the turtle... That's where it should be, Giorno. Right in there.
That's our duty as survivors. Now...let's go to the Colosseum.
OH! MY! GOD!
My grandson's already forgotten what I look like! This is unforgivable! That damn Japanese guy, stealing my precious daughter!!
Since they appear standing next to us, I've named these visions Stands!
And there you have it! Your flesh bud's been removed, bud! Ba dum tss! Hee hee!
I'm sure of it! As sure as I am that I'll burp if I drink some cola!
Gotta relax and think. "Panic" is not in my vocabulary!
Hey, relax! I'm just kidding!
I feel like I just had an icicle shoved up my butt...
I wonder if anyone has gone through 3 plane crashes and lived to tell the tale...
Hurry! Hurry! You're about to make a grown man cry!
That bastard's head is attached to the body he stole from my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar!!
It's time you learned that as far as fighting goes, Joseph Joestar is lightyears ahead of you!
If you decide to climb a mountain, and you haven't planned a route and don't even know where the top is, you're definitely going to get lost!
I'm...no match...
Joseph Joestar. Born on September 27, 1920. Wife: Suzie Q. Hobby: Collecting comic books.
YES! YES! YES! OH MY GOD!
HOLY SHIIIT!
You lose!
What you thought was an evil spirit is actually a powerful vision created by your vital energy!
I know people say I'm young for my age...b-but after running around this much...h-how could I not be out of breath?!
Stamp loser?
I may die here...and if I die...I want you to give your mother...my best...
I wanted to look cool in front of you.
I think it's the subtlest of feelings that truly decide whether or not someone likes or dislikes you in the end...
The golden spirit that inhabits the radiance of justice... We saw it once when we went to Egypt, and now I've seen it again, in Josuke and his friends...
It's not my problem!
Grr! There's a lot I CAN do, but I CAN'T let a dog-lover just get killed!
This is NOT my lucky day!
I've gotta get them before they get me!
Sucker! I can't believe you were dumb enough to fall for that! Heh heh heh!
Fighting is the last thing I wanna do!
Guess it's time I acted like a dumb dog and feigned ignorance!
Whoaaa! I'm getting dizzy!
GRIN... Ggh.
I don't need this crap. Have a nice life.
I'll take this guy on! (Dammit!)
H-he's trying to take me out right now! What is he, crazy?! This is more than just persistence! He's a bona fide killing machine!!
I was planning to live out my life without any trouble, dammit... Guess I really screwed that one up.
Deh heh heh heh heh. Hoheh. Poh. Pahee poheh!
Dammit, that stupid bird's really pissed me off now! I've had enough of this! I'm gonna make him pay if it's the last thing I do!
I let you crush me, so that I could use the air pressure to bounce up!
The hell you asking me for?! I'm just a damn dog! What are ya, some kinda moron?!
Is having a good woman and an easy life asking too much?
I...I can't beat this guy! I can't do a thing all by myself!
Don't be No. 1, be No. 2! That's how Hol Horse rolls! Got it?!
You signed your own death warrant when you decided to take me for a fool!
"The gun is mightier than the sword." Such a genius quote!
Dying before getting to say goodbye is the lay of the land, amigo.
I'm gonna blow your brains all over the floor, Mr. DIO!
Dammit! You're actually strong?!
I'm running because I love you, baby. Forever!
My Stand's a goddamn gun!
C'mon, Jean-Jean!
That's a real bad joke!
What the hell?!
N-now I finally understand, Master DIO... I should have just obeyed you to the very end... I lose...
I'm the kind of guy who fights best whenever he's partnered with someone.
Now what am I supposed to do?! What the hell do I follow this up with?!
Bluffs don't work on me.
Shoot him!
Seems like you've realized that N'doul here tracks things by sound... Heh heh heh... Not like it will change anything, though... Heh heh heh!
Let me just tell you one thing. My name is N'doul. My Stand represents the origin of the Tarot cards... Geb, one of the 9 Egyptian Glory Gods!
Trying to silence yourself now? It's far too late for that...
I know both your position and your height!
Now I have no more need to trace sound with this staff...but I'll need it when I return home.
I'm not the least bit afraid of death...
He's just so strong, profound, mighty, and beautiful... And he's the first person in the world who gave me a sense of worth.
I don't fear death. Just as long as he doesn't abandon and murder me himself.
I almost had it. Guess I didn't practice enough... Heh heh.
If I hadn't brought my water Stand back and used it to guard me, you would have already got me from behind, huh?
I've been waiting all my life to meet someone like him.
Thanks to my Stand ability, I haven't been afraid of death ever since I was a little child.
I can hear the reverberations...
I could beat anyone, and had no trouble against either criminals or killers... I wasn't even the least bit afraid of policemen, either.
He was the only person who's ever made me pray for mercy, from the bottom of my heart.
You little turds!
My chest hasn't gotten any bigger...
I'll use magnetism to pull over these power cables and electrocute you to a crisp!
You looked pretty handsome out there.
We've only just met, but I could tell from your actions that you're an intelligent man with a good sense of humor who possesses sharp judgment that comes from experience that young people simply don't have.
I even thought about making a boyfriend out of you. Heh heh heh.
Once you fall prey to Bast's magnetism, there's no escape...
You always want to touch the things you're told not to.
No, no! Unfortunately, you have to die.
I'll burn you to a crisp!
Ho ho ho ho...
Forget it. You're nothing compared to the charm of Lord DIO.
You were so sure that you had cornered me that you didn't notice that I had cornered you!
Enough already, idiot!
Heh heh heh. Make yourself at home, Joseph Joestar.
LITTLE TURD...
My Stand, Bast, is already far more powerful than you!
C-CAAAAW
SKREEEEEE
GUGAGAGA
Kshaaaaah
(GRIN)
Caaaaaw!
Grrrrr
Wheeee!
Caaaaaw!
Gyaaaaaah!
Gheeeehh!
(lick)
C-Caw
Gughehhh...
Gyaaash!
One by one, my void will destroy each and every one of you.
Wretched dog! How dare you! How dare you make me destroy something in lord DIO's image!
Avdol was crushed into tiny pieces...and died.
Jean Pierre... You didn't draw this blood. Avdol did!
Mark my words! I'm going to kill Joestar and the rest!
Now do you understand!? Well, do you!? Do you!? DO YOU!?
Sorry to disturb your slumber...
I'll defeat them all for you... I swear it!
That does it! Time to settle this once and for all, Jean Pierre!
Bastaaaaaaard!!!
You're powerless before me...
How about now?! Or now?! Or now?!
You! You're the one who enraged me so!
I have no time to waste on pain.
Whoever's reading this: Turn around, and you die.
You wretched beast! I'll stomp you to death!
This much is certain: I will find you... and I will kill you.
This is... The World!
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!
The process... The method... You think I care about that!?
WRYYYYYYYYYYYY!
You! You saw me!
If we were playing chess or shogi right now, you'd be in CHECKMATE!
It's a steamroller!
It's mixing in. Yes, this suits me well! Hu ha ha ha ha! Hu hu hu ha hu ha hu ha!
To stand on top of the world is to know no fear!
I've never felt as HIGH as this! HA HA HA HA!!
Relax. No need to be scared sick.
The sidewalk is perfectly wide enough...
Foolish human! I will rule over you! Bow before my might and intelligence!
Not that you'll be able to see or feel time actually stop...
Win, and seize control! That's it! That alone is my satisfaction!
Mmmmm! Yes! This feels so refreshing! I feel so good I could sing. Hu hu hu hu ha ha ha ha!
My head is splitting! I...I feel like I'm going to puke... Ggh... Urggh. H-how can this be...could I, DIO...be feeling ill?
Time to deliver the perfect finisher!
This is my "escape route"...
Wh-what?! How...is this possible?! It can't be! M-My leg...won't move...
Some destinies deserve to be destroyed! Some fates deserve to be vanquished! And I've already severed all of mine!!
I'm satisfied enough. Now there's no need to play with you toys anymore!
Heh... I'll give you some credit.
Stop, time! The World!!
How's that?! I've blinded you with blood! Victory is mine! Now diiieee!
All people are born with their own unique traits and characteristics. Kings have kingly traits, while cooks have cooking skills... That's just how life is.
Do you believe in gravity?
I'm on a journey to to find the right "encounter."
Great!
Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, are you?
C'mon, this is no time to daydream!
Duh, I wasn't scared of you, stupid-head! Ah crap, I sound like a little kid!
No one insults my fabulous hair!
I dunno why, really. I just suddenly thought to myself, "This isn't worth dyin' for."
I can't really put a finger on it, but something about you is kinda cool!
Repent for eternity!
This shock will be enough to blow your Stand to the moon!
If you're talkin' in your sleep, I reckon it's time I put you to bed!
This feels awesome. Like a new pair of undies on the first day of the year!
It isn't the way you think that's messed up... It's your character itself!
Just now...you said Yoshikage Kira, didn't you?!
I never let anyone speak ill of others. No matter who they are, I can't just stand by and watch!
Is this a coincidence? Or is it destiny?! This guy just let one hell of a name slip off his tongue!!
Bring out...your Deadly Queen...
Outta the way! I should still be able heal your wounds.
No problems on my end!
Please, lend me some lunch money! I forgot my change!
Some guy I've never met in my entire life suddenly tells me he's my father... Yeah, uh, okay?
Your chances of winning waved "bye bye" to you a while ago.
I'm gonna wipe that "peaceful" look right off your face.
Stop it right there! Not another damn word from you!
You're in my range, Yoshikage Kira...
Josuke here knows exactly what you're thinking!
My name is... (I guess you don't need to know, but...) ...Koichi Hirose. I'm 15.
He wouldn't know right from wrong if it kicked him in the nuts, but in a way, I admire his attitude.
You're a complete idiot! I look forward to seeing you in the afterlife!
I...I'm so happy!
I'm really getting stronger?!
But that's it! Your weakness! It's right there!
I'm not stopping the sound... Not until I hear you cry and apologize!
He looks a lot more... "normal" than I had imagined.
"Amidst the chirring of cicadas, quietness seeps into the rocks." That's from one of Basho's poems!
I told you... Don't mistake me for a small fry.
Your name...is Yoshikage Kira...
Why should I have to feel like, "I'd be so much happier if I were on the brink of diarrhea, desperate for a public toilet!" just to make it out of this alive?!
He's dead... He died standing up...
Now I'm getting even more pissed off...
H-honestly, she's frighteningly weird... I-I need to hurry up and find the courage to turn her down, or else I'm sure I'll get wrapped up in a lot of trouble!
Yukako... You can't be serious...
That's her... That unbelievably tough personality... Yeah, that's definitely Yukako!
S-H-I-T
I COULD MAKE HIM EVEN HEAVIER. WHAT IS YOUR COMMAND?
I HAVE PROTECTED YOU AS ORDERED. MY WORK IS COMPLETE.
I can't wait to get my Hand on you and wipe you out, ya dumbass!
If it's "hands-off" combat you want, The Hand can do the business! Come on!
So then I said, "I'm goin' to Morioh Town," and then I woke up. Boy, that was a helluva dream...
All this thinking is hurting my brain!
Look, I'm comin' closer! See that? TELEPORTATION! BOOYAH!
So I can surpass my older brother, huh? Thanks for the lesson, Chili Pepper.
This guy's a maniac. He'll do just about anything short of sacrificing his own life in order to gather material for his manga!
I'm going home... I feel weird. Like, something's really bugging me...
Nobody messes with Okuyasu Nijimura and lives to tell about it!
Niiiiice!
Harmony, right? "Perfect blend," right?
I feel great! Like I just woke up from 10 hours of sleep!
I don't think so! Okuyasu Nijimura's The Hand is going to wipe you out, Josuke Higashikata!
You're bringing out your Stand in front of us?! I hope you're prepared to die, punkass!
The air...the air just breathed fire!
Not even I know where the stuff I erase goes...
But I didn't get touched...I didn't...
Look at how loosened up my shoulder joints are now!
Move around all you want, you dumbass! I'm gonna flatten your Stand anyway!
If it's "hands-off" combat you want, The Hand can do the business! Come on!
Let's see how this tastes.
What a great story! What an amazing experience! I'm so very pleased!
Like hell I will!
Winning means being able to look down at your opponent like this!
Rohan Kishibe isn't gonna listen to some amateur!
Heaven's Door can open the door of your heart.
It looks positively horrendous! How can you stand to walk around with that in this day and age!?
I draw manga because I want people to read them!
I bet all my readers are going to love your shining personality!
You dare insult ME, cretin?!
It appears that my Stand, Heaven's Door, can't read my own distant memories...or my fate...
Did you think the great Rohan Kishibe draws manga just for money or praise!?
Reality is true entertainment!
I feel like you and I could get along. Don't you agree?
Oh, I've got the perfect Safety Lock for you.
I want to draw so much! I must keep drawing!
Koichi!
An unlucky "rock"!
So that people will read it. That's all. Just one simple reason, and I couldn't care less about anything else!
Oh my... Yes! This is amazing! I think I may have just come across my greatest manga idea yet!
Your memories are mine! I'm going to use them in my manga!
Listen up! The hardest thing of all is surpassing oneself!
What are you...doing? This makes no sense! This makes no sense!
What a strange and terrible feeling!
I will protect Papa and Mama from him!
I can sell it to ya for a cool 10,000 yen! Shee shee shee!
I can spot lies a mile away!
Here's a small token of kindness...since, you know...we're friends and all...
Oh, I'm such a geenyis!
Fine then, I'll give it to you the hard way! I'll give it all to you! We're friends, after all!
My Harvest is invincible!
Hey sister! I'm rolling in cash! How 'bout a date?
No one can beat my Harvest!
You keep chasing me and I'll kill you!
Wha—?! Wha—?! Wha—?! Wh-what the—?! My sandwich!!
Can you see my Harvest?!
Oh! It DOES make sense.
A-Ahem!
You're a murderer! And Reimi Sugimoto is looking for you!
You want proof? Hm?
It's not fair unless you count each one of my Stands!!
Which is it?! Do you love me, or not?! I want an answer right now!
By the way, will you...come and see me again?
You're hungry, aren't you? What would you like to eat first? Shrimp? Okay!<icon heart> Say aaaah! Aaah!
Do it, or else you won't be able to become big, strong man for me!
You poor thing, I've done some absolutely terrible things to you. I'm such a bad girl, aren't I?
I'm going to make you love me! Or else...I might kill you...
Ever since I was a child, my eyelid muscles have twitched whenever I get excited, and then I start to feel a little violent...
By the way, let me just ask you one more time... You like me, right?
I'm going to rip that piss-stained little pecker of yours right off, and yank out all your guts while I'm at it!
I like you even more now! You don't even need to pay attention to me! Just thinking about you makes me happy enough, Koichi!
K-Koichi... Instead of standing and talking like this, would you like to sit down somewhere and have a chat? Umm, if you'd like, that is...
Koichi likes me too... I can feel it now...
Why does it only last for 30 minutes?!
You little sphincter!
Our hearts are connected... Koichi's heart is flowing into mine...
If anyone damages my good looks, they'll pay dearly!
We're the perfect match!
Ahh! Someday I want to do something girly with Koichi, like eat a chocolate parfait together as we bask in the sweet, romantic atmosphere...
K-Koichi's touching my hand...I can't believe it...! KOICHI'S HAND is on top of MY HAND...!
Koichi and I are speaking to each other, heart-to-heart. This it...this is the feeling!
You're way too immature to be my groupie!
You see that? The entire town's electric grid is on my side!
Sucker! I was only pretending to freak out!
You wanna get nuts?! Let's get nuts!
Oh, what's that? You wanna leave behind a last will and testament? Better be quick about it!
Damn it, I gotta rethink my stupid ideas!
I rock harder than ever!
I'll kill your mom, too!
Behold what's in my heart: the ultimate rage!
You know you love me. <icon heart>
Gonna knock your ass out!
As soon as that old fart gets to the port, I'm gonna kill him!
Should I laugh, or yawn?! Decisions, decisions...
My dream is to become an ultra super guitarist and live a hot, action-packed life!
This guitar's body is made of Honduran mahogany from 1973, creating the highest quality sound possible. It sucks up all my sweat as I play, and the more I sweat, the better it sounds!
With steel strings, double coils are more capable of preventing noise from spreading out compared to single coils, so I prefer double coil humbuckers, since they give the guitar more power!
When I move the whammy bar like this and make my guitar squeal, it just sounds so cool!
I'll beat you with my pinky!
I demand thunderous applause from the foolish masses!
I think we're going to have a lot of fun this weekend...just the two of us...
No no no no no no no no!
I'll get away with it. You'll see.
He's wearing his socks inside out... Has he no shame?!
I'm going to blow you to smithereens! Then peaceful rest will be mine at last!
Why so down?
My Heart Attack has no weakness!
It doesn't matter what attack I use. It's your fate to be defeated here.
I've told you before: all I want is to live peacefully.
Where are you taking me...?
Before you tell anyone about me...I need to eliminate you.
Deadly Queen can turn anything it touches into a bomb...
No one can know the true identity of Yoshikage Kira...
Damn you! Why do I feel so defeated?
Now! Turn around! Hoo... You're going to turn around right now!
Everything in my sights dies.
I will survive...and live on in peace.
A gym is opening near Budougaoka High... Maybe I should join? I need to build up some stamina...
Come to my place, and I'll take very good care of you, with only the purest of intentions...
My Deadly Queen's Heart Attack never fails to eliminate its targets...
This is the first time I've been pushed so far...by the police, or anyone...
It seems that I won't be able to sleep in peace. But only for tonight!
I can't place it, but somehow I feel divine luck is always on Yoshikage Kira's side.
Your Stand felt very weak... It was as easy to catch as a pop fly.
I even feel slightly defeated...
You've found me out: I'm Yoshikage Kira. Ha ha ha ha ha! Tell whoever you like.
I cut off the part with the hands and put it up in my room. I want to cut off your hands, too.
No! I'm at my limit! I'm gonna push it!
No great joy, but no sign of deep despair, either. A quiet life, like that of a plant's...
I'm not leaving this town... ever!
You're rather cute... when your mouth is shut.
We all need to get along...and be kind to one another...
Oh how wonderful it must be to not have a care in the world.
In Japanese, the word destiny is written as "that which brings life"! Heh heh... That's exactly it.
Didn't you learn not to answer a question with a question in school?
When my nails start to grow, I become unable to suppress my feelings.
No one can suppress the disposition I was born with.
Destiny has allied itself with Yoshikage Kira!
You see, my son is being very unreasonable, so I need to educate him...
Yes. It'll only take...15 minutes. Yes...
I'm very sorry...yes. As soon as I finish...yes. I'll go right the office...yes! I'll be right over...yes.
Th-this can't be—how... There must be...some mistake... It's...too horrible...
How refreshing... It certainly feels refreshing, doesn't it?
Being cornered like this is merely a chance for me to calmly assess the situation and turn things back around...
Well, well. Did you just say my real name? Heh heh heh...
A dream... This is a dream...
Your hands... The joints and skin are so smooth...
The first time I saw it... I, well, you'll have to excuse my language, but... Heh heh...
I happened to...get aroused...
Push it... Push it. Now! Push it! Now! Push...the...switch...
You look like someone who came prepared.
Your "end" has no ending! That's the power of Golden Wind Requiem!
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream!
Once should've been enough. But I have to tell you twice? Do you have half a brain?!
In the end, only the truth survives.
That which is inherited must move toward what lies beyond!
"Know yourself...?" You think someone like you ever really can?
Only one road left for you to follow!
True preparation means cutting open a bright path through the darkest of fields!
Yeah, well, you took a punch as powerful as the ones you throw yourself. Deal with it!
Are you sure you'll be able to survive this?
Life... spring forth!
Were your actions born from truth...or merely superficial evil? Time to find out.
Sincere actions born from truth will never perish...
It's all over now... There's no road ahead for him.
And he'll never, ever reach truth... He cannot even reach the final fate ordained for him: death.
Your senses are the only thing that are going wild. Every move you make looks painfully slow...
He cannot even reach the final fate ordained for him: death.
Don't even think about following me.
There's one thing I will never allow at any cost: your escape.
Don't resist and I promise that knocking you out is the worst I'll do.
I'm Giorno Giovanna. Nice to meet you.
Ciao.
I'm telling you, it's impossible! Act like a real gangster and stop struggling!
Golden Wind is my Stand. It can put an end to anything within 2 meters!
YOU WILL NEVER REACH TRUTH!
THIS... IS REQUIEM
MUDA! MUDA MUDA MUDA! MUDAAAAH!
NOT EVEN MY MASTER, GIORNO GIOVANNA, TRULY KNOWS
This one's special. When he says he's going to do something, it's as good as done.
I'll never forgive you! You betrayed me again!
I did what I thought was right. I regret nothing.
Arrivederci! (Farewell)
Answer me. This interrogation has now become a torture!
Ah-ow! I've got this sharp pain creeping up on me. Aah. Aaaaagh!
This nauseating evil!
Worry not—everything will return to its proper form. Just as the way it should be.
Fate is a sleeping slave... We managed to release it, and now we've won.
You'd never be able to understand my soul!
Hmm, you taste of lies, Giorno Giovanna!
I can see that you're truly prepared for this!
I'll show you. I'm far more prepared than you are!
"Carry out the mission and protect our men." Think you can handle that?
Stop talking. You're not making any sense.
How about it? My skills make you shiver, no?
Using the ignorant simply for his own benefit...it's vomit-inducing evil!!
All you should be worried about is what happens after the zippers split you into pieces and scatter you all over the ground.
No matter how twisted this world may be, I will walk the path I believe in!
I'm rubbing you out... Now!
He's seriously...planning to kill me...
This is what true happiness is... This is how it should be. Don't worry...and give everyone my regards...
If we defeat the boss and go in order of talent, that makes me next in line to be in charge!
The number four always brings bad luck!
My true preparation begins here! Pistols! Show me what you're made of!
Which do you want me to use? The glasses, or the fishing line?
Why don't you kiss the road, huh? Use all that momentum you've got and give it a nice, big, wet one!
Enough, No. 3! You're making No. 5 cry!
I want to settle this here. I'm gonna shoot one straight in your mouth!
My Stand's more of the silent-killer type.
Things? They're not things! They hate it when people treat them like pets!
Uno! Due! And you're dead! Let's see you "prepare" for that!
Bullets! The point of impact is the crown of his head!
I swear I'll cut you down... with one shot!
Ahh! Be gentle, gentle! No, more gentle! Don't take off my clothes! That feels good! Ahh, no, don't!
What happened to my face?! And I stink! I stink like BO!!
My fingers are hairy!! My nails are ugly, weirdly-shaped and caked with dirt! I can't live with thiiiis!!
If they haven't made a sculpture of you yet, then you've still got some life left to live...
Hahhhh hah hahhhhh... Ukekekekekeke!
I can't guarantee you won't have another hole between your eyeballs now.
4 shots... What the hell? I only have 4 left! Why 4?! Come on!!
Come on! Quit fighting! Just get along and start chowing down!
Pass, pass, pass!
Four shots means bad, bad juju!
This guy's freakin' me out, man!
You can't load that number. Nothing good will come of it!
Come oooooon!
Aim! Aim, you idiots!
"I'm going in!" "Me too!" "Me three!"
Back down? You think I'd back down from something like this?!
Volare via!
I always carry out my orders!
Damn it! He got away!
I'm sick of this!
Heaven, hell, and heller!
Don't order me to stay! Don't!
Sooooooo what if I can't shoot?! I still have another way to kill youuuuuu!!
I'm going to school once I get back home. I'm sick of people saying I'm stupid!
Ah! I got junk in my eye! I can't see! I can't tell if you're two people or not! Nope, I can't see a thing at all!
Take this! Li'l Bomber!!
Your shopping list... I can't finish it. All the money and the stuff got burned.
A stapler! Ha ha ha! It's bound like a comic book now!
2 + 2 is 5! 3 x 3 is 8!
Yeah! That's right!
I'll kill ya! I'll straight up kill ya!
Ha ha ha! Your very name dooms you to an eternity in HELL!
You must be an idiot!
You brainless pile of crap!
Oooh, you've got a little bump there. It's pretty big, too!
What happened!? Where did you hide it!?
I hope you don't mind, but I just wanted to give him some spaghetti!
Once you see my ability, you'll die.
You've lost touch with reality... Nobody gets through life on dreams alone!
You have my utmost respect!
What's wrong with you guys!? You're going to be completely cut off now!
You messing with me, punk?!
You're really something. Just do as you were taught, and you can make it happen.
Purple Smoke's virus is now spreading out through your entire body! Once it infects someone, not even I can stop it!
Take off my jacket? Here? Uh...but why?
I get what you're saying... And you're right.
Why... Have you lost your mind?! What's going on inside your head?!
All for a girl we just met two days ago, who we've barely even spoken with?!
Trish is practically a stranger to us! We don't even know what kind of MUSIC she likes!
This has nothing to do with us! We could just feign ignorance!
How could you get swept up in your emotions!?
Well... That's certainly got some flavor to it...
Is your name "Public Restroom?"
Why can I suddenly see all these bizarre things? What's going on?!
Dammit! Stay back until I get this door closed!!
Keep looking, Giorno! Find him! I can feel that he's still alive! We won't be able to rest easy until we know for sure!
I'm missing my handkerchief, so go buy me one. Oh, and get me the latest issue of Italian Vogue and a bottle of Givenchy N°2 Blush while you're at it.
I need to know the truth about my parents!
Never let go of that arrow, Giorno! We can't let the boss touch it ever again!!
Uh... Don't misunderstand!! I didn't actually touch it! The elastic part was just a little itchy!
You wear panties so tight that they make your butt look perky! That's why I got itchy, because the elastic part's too damn tight! Your bra is also smooshing your chest!
I said some weird stuff back there... I guess I just sort of panicked. It doesn't really bother me now. In fact, it kind of brings back memories...
Why am I being chased down by a father who I don't even know?!
That's Giorno's Requiem...
I can't hurry! If I hurry, I'll die!
Could you take off that jacket? Don't worry, it's not like I want to see you naked or anything.
I already figured that out...a while back...
I'm not going to get scared or run from the fate I inherited from you!!
Just who am I...?
Arrivederci! (Farewell)
I'm going to...overcome this...
WANNABEEEEEEEEEE
Being this soft means I'm even more unbreakable than diamond!
With the strength of a thousand fists!
You now have the power to make any matter in the world softer!
Spicy Lady!!
What about Trish? What my daughter says or does has nothing to do with you!
Don't come near me! Stay away!
Doppio, oh Doppio. My poor, precious Doppio...
No one must be allowed to threaten my eternal seat on the apex. I'll erase every last threat!
Giorno Giovanna... I'm not even going to give you enough time to regret the fact that you're dead!
True fear comes from the past you never knew.
Now you've pissed me off!
It's the result that counts! The result is the only thing that lives in infamy!
No one who senses my true nature can be be allowed to survive!
I, Diavolo, am emperor! Just as I always was!
Think it over again! Who is the one king worthy of holding the arrow?!
I don't know what the hell's going on, but eat this!
"Clouds in the sky get torn apart without ever realizing that they're flying!" "Not even a flame can feel itself being extinguished!"
Human growth is all about conquering one's immature past. Wouldn't you agree, Jean Pierre?!
How many times am I going to die? Where... What's going to come and attack me next?! I, I...
I can push ahead all time aside from my own!
With the future laid out before me, all I need to do is find the pitfall that pops up! As long as I avoid it, my life will never sink—I'll be able to remain on top forever!
If you've seen Emperor Crimson, it's already your time...nay, you're no longer in this world!
Those who know my true nature cannot be left alive.
You can try and erase it, but the past always has true human peace in a choke hold.
I'm...still...urgh...just...barely...ggh...a-alive...somehow...
No... I can't run away from this!! I'll lose my pride... I need to defeat them here!
I need to seal up the pitfalls that threaten me!
This a trial. I accept this as a trial to conquer my past!
Controlling the arrow is no job for a weakling!!
BRING RING RING RING RING
Ciao. Yes, Doppio speaking.
Why must I attract nothing but idiots?! Is everyone in this world an idiot?!
I'm lonely... Boss...please call me like you always do... I'm waiting...
Screw you!! Why the hell would you call me at a time like this?!
That's a wrap!
There may only be one road ahead, but with the right plan, anything's possible.
Hop in, tyke! You can trust me. I'm Irene. And he's Annakiss.
I think I get it. I think I finally understand my dad.
You need to survive! You... are "hope" itself!
Well, looks like we've reached a new dawn for the human race!
Leave me alone! I want my lawyer!
Man, give me a damn break...
ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAAA!
He saw me doing "it"... Y-you know, the word that starts with "ma"...
Alright, Anastasia. Go ahead and ask.
Of course I watch the stars. And I'll never stop until I see my father.
So we meet again... Pale Snake!! I never thought I'd be able to unmask you this way—that I'd come face to face with you again like this!
There's hope in the way you think, not darkness.
Lucky!<icon heart> Woo-hoo!
I don't have any plans to break out of prison later... I'm doing it now!
Shuddup... Don't order me around like I'm your daughter or something!
I'm going to steal three things from you!
My father's memories, the disc you stole from F.F., and your life!
If you're going to bring it... then bring it now!
How about it? Wanna join forces with me? It's your call, but don't kill anyone!
What are handcuffs for? Not to keep you from escaping! To make you submit!
Now I understand... I understand that I don't understand at all.
Okay, Anastasia. You can pop the question... And I'm not just saying that because we might die here!
I'm the one who gives out orders here.
Ready? This kick is for Gloria!
I want to cry... but I know I don't have the time to.
Here! Take my panties! Take them already!
Give me a scream... A nice, long one.
Straight down the center of his face!
Well? Wouldn't you feel really lucky?
Smack is my license...for vengeance!
This sticker? It comes from ME. It's a piece of what I am!
Glad you made it! Time to rip you apart!
You plankton punk!
Revenge is the way to settling the score with your own fate!
Oh my god!
Hey! Kid! You gonna ride this bus? Perfect! Can you make some change for me?
Why are you thinking about dying!? There's still a ton of fun, lucky stuff that might happen to you!
It's not always Monday!
When I say perfect, I mean it'd make the perfect coffin!
You think I want to live out a life where one of my family members has been thrown into the gutter, and I'm forced to forget it? Hell no! I'm prepared to do what it takes to change my life!
And the next one... And the next one too! They're all for Gloria!
Stickers come out of my hands. It's a fact. And soon, I realized... It's pretty useful.
At the end of the day, you're all you've got!
Give me your blessing! I can't get married without it!
And... RELEASE!
If I manage to survive this...I think I'll propose to Jolyne. Ha ha ha ha ha...
I dove into your body itself.
So are you gonna bring it or what?
I've had such good luck as of late... Right?
Make like a frog and hop along, loser!
I hope you're ready... Ready to regret the day you were born?!
The moment it hits, all I have to do is guard!
Please give me your daughter's hand in marriage!
She has the purest heart and intentions... They illuminated my dark heart, and saved it from the brink of ruin!
Keep moving through the marsh, until you reach the ocean!!
Adorable... Ohh... Jolyne, you're just so adorable...
First, Diver Drive receives the initial damage...
Yes... That's how it should be. Stare at me more. Those eyes... I need more...
I'm a curse on my own existence!
You're the worst kind of evil. An evil that doesn't know it's evil!
Get away from me... I'll kick you to death.
Weather Forecast manipulates weather.
Don't worry. I'll suck it up in my clouds. If you drop your undies, that is.
Just act like you don't notice...
So THAT's why you can't answer me!
I want to wash my hands, but this spout...it doesn't even have handles. I'm looking for them.
I'll cut off the highway with torrential rains, up to 30km ahead!!
You need to pee? Just go and do it in the corner.
What are your plans? I'm going after the priest too...after I break out of here.
North... Just keep heading north.
I can't possibly think of any explanation for this...
Sorry, but I don't know you people.
I can just sort of tell...from the air.
Who said you could touch me?! I'm gonna kill you!
Wanna go do something fun? Let's let off some steam!
I do feel bad for them, but deep down, I also feel some kind of satisfaction...
If she looks dumber than that tree over there, then talk to her.
Gah hah hah! Now this is a massage! Do it more on my back! Yeah!!
The only thing I live for is getting my revenge on that scumbag!
Oh maaaan... I broke that store's window...!
I can no longer suppress my anger... I'm finishing this here!
Satisfied? Perla—your sister—ended up this way because of what YOU did!
I knew it... Destiny has allied itself with me and blessed me with this trial!
My Time Acceleration has taken us to our final destination! The universe has completely looped around!
You damned brat!
By the name of God, I will smite you!
It's the bloodline of the Joestars that made me what I am!
DIO! All I need to do is awaken you, and then utilize you!
Our preparation will blow despair into oblivion! We stand now at a turning point for mankind!
I respect the first person who tried to eat a mushroom. He risked being poisoned for it!
People are defeated due to the shame in their hearts. People die for their shame.
Glory be to God! We're about to witness the birth of Heaven!
41, 43, 47... Count in prime numbers, for no one can ever divide them!
I can invert gravity based on where I'm standing.
How far will you reach? I want to join you.
Weep at your own weakness!
Destiny is what we must conquer in order to achieve human happiness...
I can feel it! This is the spot!!
I imagine it's beyond your comprehension, but I'll tell you one last time just in case: Time will accelerate.
Go on, shoot... Then I can die like a true martyr.
You will not escape! This ends here, no matter what! This karma must not be taken into the future!
A new world! The human race has reached an endpoint and entered a new dawn!
It all revolves around my body!
Stand down... You would hardly even be a trial for me.
Seems you were two seconds too late...
People must go to Heaven! Every human goal points toward it!
People meet through gravity. We meet those whom we are destined to meet!
This is the story of my first step.
Thanks. That's all I can think of to say.
Guess we should pray, huh? For safe passage across the sea.
I'll expose your secret! I'll figure out what this Spin really is!
I can't win unless I'm starving for victory.
It was such a long road. Such a long, roundabout path...
If you're in doubt, don't shoot! But I no longer have any trace of doubt in my mind!
I won't let anyone have it... I'm the only one who can settle this score!
I'm still in the red! I just want to make it to zero!
Pick it up, President Valentine.
In a situation like this, I wish I could say something all tough and cool like Gyro.
There's no way I could do that!
I need an even nobler hunger!
What a joke!
Farewell, Gyro... Farewell.
Gyro... I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I wanted to trust him... I really wanted to trust the President...
I, Johnny Joestar, am the only person in the world who understands that corpse...
Whoa! That's the craziest thing I've heard all year!
Make me believe you!
It all makes sense now, Gyro... This is what Lesson 5 was for!
Are you a "just" person?
What in the world are you doing, Gyro Zeppeli?!
Do you know what a "bug bite fetish" is? Well, they turn me on! End of story!
Yikes! That sounded really good! Too good! It's stuck in my head now! Especially the "rella rella" part!
Life, death... Who's good, and who's evil... None of that matters!
Nyo-ho!
"The long way was the best shortcut for me."
My real name...you promised... You won't tell anyone, right?
I joined this race to win! My homeland awaits me!
You have to let a horse run free. Let it gallop over the grass as nature intended!
I need to be convinced. That takes first priority!
Rella rella rella rella!
Pay your respects!
That's pretty rude of ya.
A man's world sure ain't an easy one!
Ehhh, what was it again? I forgot. Ha ha ha!
Pizza mozzarella! Pizza mozzarella! Rella rella rella rella...
I'll happily accept anything other than an illness.
Go, Johnny, go! Go!! Go!
Otherwise I won't be able to move forward! Or go anywhere! I won't even be able to search for a road to the future!
Hey...let's share our secrets here. There's gotta be something you're hiding from people, right? Let's tell each other the truth.
He'd never shoot before his opponent. He purposely let his opponent shoot first...
I'll beat you down...then beat you down again!
I swear to you! I don't know anything either!
My real name is Julius Caesar Zeppeli.
If this is how it was meant to be... I won't fight it.
Do you have to protect a king or a president? Why not a girl?
Seems like this isn't a technique, but rather, an ability.
The long way around was the best shortcut.
Next up is Lesson 5!
Filthy acts, at a reasonable price.
My soul is in clear, unclouded tandem with my actions! Everything I do is for justice!
Tah dah!
Yes! Yesss!
I'm a patriot. Everything I've done has been for the sake of my country.
It was me! I'm the one who picked up the first napkin!
So far, so good... Soon they will all be mine!
So the goddess exists... And she's on my side!
You are preventing my country from finding happiness!
I can exist in the same place in two different worlds at the same time.
This trial will end with the shedding of your blood.
Stop looking at things from just one viewpoint.
I will take no revenge. I promise you that this will be the end.
Must...escape...to the next dimension...and hide...
The pluses and the minuses always come to a balance.
The one who takes the first napkin must be respected by the masses!
It's impossible to make everyone happy.
The holy corpse has chosen VALENTINE!
What a horrifying phenomenon... The Infinite Spin energy of the Steel Balls!
You've reached the end of the line, Gyro!!
You threw an elliptical ball!
I lost... I completely lost! I couldn't possibly win now. You...are the victor...
Don't tell me this means I'm going to be buried alive over and over again for all of eternity?!
My D4C is the only energy that can transcend the dimensional barrier!
Stop it! WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!
I'm going to teach you the meaning of the word "retire"!
(Sniff) Hmm. (Sniff) That's coffee. Smells like coffee, anyway. Is someone making coffee? It smells really good...
Want some camouflage? Do you like lamps? I mean, you won't light up or anything...
The winds of victory are at this Dio's back...
WRYYYYYYY!
This is the "line" to the world that I'm going to inherit!!
The end will come before you even stop!
Time's stopped for five seconds!
You can take that Spin...and stick it back where it came from!
The World... Time is mine and mine alone!
"You're all guilty!"
Humans are just like flocks of pigeons. If one flies right, they all fly right. People are nothing but attention-seekers who only care about their own profit and vanity!
I'll forgive the fact that my mother died for those scumbags, but I'm not going to let things end there. I'm going to attract more attention than anyone else, and rule those pigeons from the very top!
If you plan to seduce me to get me to sympathize with you, just wait until my leg heals. I'll play with you all you want. I'll drag you down as far as a woman can go, then kill you as I toy with you!
THE WORLD! Get away!! Stop tiiime!!
You wretched hicks!!
This trial will be "Subjugation and Certain Death!"
How about...Manhattan Island, in New York?
I need to kill him soon...or else he'll get a decisive lead on me!
There isn't a creature alive that has better kinetic vision than Frightening Monsters!
I think it's about time I claimed what's mine.
I'm going to cut your flesh into pieces, then line all your organs up on the ground, in order!!
Money...I want money... Simple, right?
The glory of the Steel Ball Run race is something powerful enough to influence even the British monarchy! I'll do whatever it takes to make it mine!
Who, me?
Who the hell am I? I can't remember anything...
Delicious!
I swear I'll make you answer me! Tell me! Who are you?!
I've made up my mind not to listen to anyone's crap anymore!
I am me, without a doubt! The me that's thinking right now...is definitely me!
No, sorry... I didn't really have time to look at my opponent's crotch or anything...
When my bubbles pop after touching you, they take something away from you.
Hey, Yasuho... think you can take a look at the other side?
So slippery!
ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!
The winner is...me! By a mile!
You said my king and rook were forked, but you're wrong! I just put YOU in checkmate!
I'm Josuke Higashikata (19). My name and age are both 'temporary' because I've lost my memories.
I'll place a bet... Count me in!
So you don't show your backsides to each other, eh?
I'd like to say it loud and clear, if you don't mind... Looks like I won.
The winner is...me!! My Giant Stag Beetle won!
Thank you very much!!
"'Sef"... That name you keep calling me by... Is it mine?
Teach me about my past.
Did you just say my real name? Jose...Josefumi...
Yoshikage Kira is dead.
"I was alive once before." "I lost my memories..." My body was involved in an "equal exchange," but... "What happened? Tell me..." "Who am I?"
Me?! The reason I look like this is because I know where the fruit trees are?! Is that what you're saying?!
N-Not my Yasuho... How could you?!
You're finished!
This is "Shakedown Road"... Someone's gonna get shook down.
RERORERORERORERO!
Oh, good... It's my puke!!
Pleaaase make it a little bit cheaper!
The center's always been my spot, ever since I was little... I always got to sit next to dad. I want to sit next to him!
Who in their right mind would cross a dangerous bridge like that without any guarantee?!
I didn't lose to an idiot like you...and I never will!
Oh wait, I haven't pushed the record button yet. Sorry...
What are you talking about, Josuke? Of course! You're family, after all!
Did you just say you "like Joshu"?! Ha ha ha ha! Really?! Heh heh heh heh! Yasuhooo! You finally came back to me!
It's...wet? H-has it been wet...ever since you c-called me? The whole time...?
Strip! Strip! You too, Yasuho, hurry up and strip!
What? Jo...suke? Suke? Josuke?
The first thing he did when he got to school was join the basketball club, and then everyone started bullying him—but I saved him! Then he slipped on first base, fell and hit his head... Keh keh!
I just happened to run into Yasuho at the Sesame Honey Cafe! Then, of all things, she confessed her love to me, so we went back to her house and had ourselves a love fest!
Do your beeeest, hey!
Urgh! Gross alert! Gross alert!
What an unbelievably crazy battle!
I would've won if it was judged by points!
Josuke, your nose is bleeding.
Just think to yourself, "Okay, he may as well have it."
What's wrong, JoJo? Danny won't drop that toy gun?
It's because you're trying to force it away from him, JoJo.
And you call yourself a gentleman?! With those manners?!
Dying in your son's arms...may not be...a bad way...to go...
Aah... I wish today would never end!
Erina Joestar will die by your side.
Oh my! It's simply too noble!
Jonathan Joestar's life has vanished into the void...
He will become a dark secret of history that nobody in the world ever finds out about.
The people of the world will never hear about the proud and noble life he led, but...
Eventually, his descendants will.
And the same goes for the new life within me.
These tears are tears of happiness. I'm happy that you're here.
Ohhh... But for me, it requires a cruel courage!
Gotcha, sucker!
My name is Dire!
My special move, Thunder Split Attack!
Thunder Cross Split Attack!
Heh heh... Th-the thorns of my hamon-laded rose...must burn...heh...
The zombies are piling up on the edge of town!
He's got amino acids! Cells! A low, yet noticeable body temperature! And a pulse! This guy is alive!!
Th-this is bad! He just got punched, but JoJo's the kind of guy who'll get angrier about the fact that the clothes Ms Erina bought him got stained with blood!
He's the most evolved creature on the planet now! I can't let him get loose, even if it costs me my life! Fifty years ago, this became my destiny!
You look as sad and laughable as a howling mutt who's just lost his dinner!
Jonathan's father. Jonathan. George... The men of the Joestar family have always died young...and I don't want to lose you as well!
Learn how to breathe ten times a second!
You're Suzie Q... Wait a minute! What's that on your left ring finger?!
Breathe in for ten minutes straight, then breathe out for another ten!
Hmph, I see.
Now you're gonna have to deal with me, Enyaba! Me and my Stand, the card of Justiiiiiiiice!!
Justice is a fog Stand that can control corpses!
I want you to lick that toilet clean! Lick it! Liiickkk iiit! Rero rero rero rero!
Lord...DIO...trusts in me!
In time, it'll become as easy as snapping an HB pencil in half!
Good!
I'll just take this as a reminder that you should never underestimate any kind of opponent...
I-I can't speak...or breathe! I c—hcch, cchhh...
Gambling and human relationships are the same to me. They both hinge on deception, and whoever cries first loses.
It's Darby... Never make that mistake again! My name is DARBY! Not Orby, and not Barby!
Exactly!
I'm a natural at gaming! You'll never beat me!
Don't tell me it's gonna be an ORA ORA!?
Grrrrrrrrrrr!
When you show someone your prized collection, you expect a few words of praise.
I bet...Star Platinum will attack me first with its left arm!
I'm the boss man, Tamami. You want guts? I got 'em!
I'll slap on my lock and get that guilty heart to pay its dues in a jiffy!
Hey Koichi! Let me carry your bag to school for you!
No matter who wins, I'm gonna handle things fair and square.
Stand users are drawn to other Stand users in the end.
I'm saying, what's the difference between you and me? Come on! Tell me!
I hate that Josuke guy, but I feel like I'll be able to get along with you!
There you go! Eat up!
I can't let that slide! I suggest you prepare yourself!
As you wish, io capito.
What do you think you're doing here?! You... You saw me!
The kitchen must always be clean!
My greatest joy and pleasure in life is comforting my customers and serving them my cuisine.
MESSHAH!
That killer's got to be brought to justice!
Rohan! N-No!
You need a good, hard slap to make you see the truth. You're already dead!
The time of judgment is at hand, Yoshikage Kira!
All I know is that—at the very least—it's a place where you'll never have any peace of mind...
Thank you, everyone. Farewell...
I'll never lose! I've got luck on my side!
Wanna play rock, paper, scissors?
I'm gonna tell you one more time: You're going down!
If I have to obey what you write... If my mind has no choice but to follow your orders, then...!
Once I see what makes you scared, you're mine! You'll be consumed by Misterioso's attack!
No one's immune to it. When they're scared, they give away a little telltale sign.
You know, that's really not a smart move.
"No man is free from fear."
Drink some tea...and let's have a little chat...
My Stand will solve the mystery!
Get on that bus... Yes, it's coming back to me... That's right!
Yeah, but you know, once upon a time, I had nowhere to live and no place to go, too.
I can replay all those memories!
You know, I'm a sad excuse for a man. I never finish what I start...because I always manage to screw things up along the way.
I need to go... I need to return to my allies!!
Then the deed's already done!
But the past tense "killed"—now that makes sense.
You're... gonna get... the glory...
I said you weren't qualified to be in charge before, but I take it back. I was out of line.
You still don't get it, do you, Pesci! You little mammone!
If we want glory, we need to grow!
If you're thinking, "I'm gonna kill his ass..."
What's the big deal? Every year, passenger planes crash all around the world. This'll be way simpler than that!
Pesci, Pesci, Pesci, Pesci!
Prosciuuuuuuttooo!
I get it, Prosciutto! I finally understand how prepared you were... not with your words, but with my heart!
We can't go back now!
When you've made up your mind you're gonna do something, you've gotta throw yourself headlong into it. I'm throwing myself headlong in to everything from now on!
When you start thinking about "killing", it's as good as done, right bro?
Stop hitting me, bro!
The shock is traveling along the string!
Bro! Prosciutto! I knew you were awesome, bro!
I'm gonna finish what my bro started!
Di molto, di molto bene! Excellent!
There's clearly nothing wrong with your physical condition if you can dish out a beating like that!
Yes! What a wonderful slap that was! The snap in your wrist, and the way you used your waist...
What the hell's that supposed to mean! Don't get clever with me, damn you!
You really piss me off, you know that?! How dare you try to make me look like a fool! Graah!
Nothing can keep on moving in my freezing world. Everything grinds to a halt!
Why isn't it called "Death in Venezia," huh? Whyyyy!?
You smack-talking me? Really? Me!? Speak Italian, you dope! Italiano!
Freezing temperatures can make the entire world stand still!
I could even stop a runaway train! Or a tempestuous ocean!
You really OK with that? I'm not OK with it at all...
Three? You want three lumps of sugar, you greedy little scamp?
YadaaaaaaAAAAABAAAAAAAAAA
Nothing feeds the spirit more than curiosity.
Y--You j-just said...if I d-didn't move...you wouldn't hurt me...
Green Tea! Release your mold!
Good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy!
Yes! Show it to me! Let the despair spill out onto your face!
Isn't "bella donna" a lethal poison?
What, did you think I'd be sad? You... You're nothing to me now that you've lost!
I know thaaaaat! What you, a, a...a, a, a language teacher!?
The more you hide, the more defeat will catch up to you!
I'm so, so... What was it? Not sever, not cleaver, but...
But you're WEAK! And you LOST!
I'm... Emporio.
This is the DISC Jolyne asked me to hang on toooo!
A fate worse than death awaits you.
Gravity also brings people together! You failed to leave all your karma behind!
Take this, and never let go of it... Treasure it as much as you treasure your own mother...
Help me... Ahh, help me...! My pee...it's all bloody... I'm pissing blood!!
That's what I'm talking about!
This is just me. Just me saying goodbye.
I wanna protect you.
Being alive is all about making memories...
Memories give my cells courage. That's where my "intelligence" comes from!
I can completely heal myself on my own! OK?
Look at me, Jolyne. This is my soul... This is my intelligence.
I'm the neutral party here. Look ahead!
Great misfortune is on its way here.
Don't attack me! You'll just keep missing!
The result should be obvious now...
This isn't the end for me! I have a right to be happy!
Now I finally know why my life's always been a total mess!
Just shut your mouth already!
I, Versus, am the invincible one here! There isn't anything Underworld can't do!
Are you just gonna take all that and go "Ohhhh wellll, I guess I did OK!?"
What "rules?" I *am* the damn rules!
There are no losers in this race. We're all adventurers!
And he's handsome, too!
You want to know about failure? Well, listen up! True failure means losing your pioneer spirit! It's someone not challenging themselves to overcome adversity!
Welcome...to a real man's world!
And so... we meet again.
It's called Mando. Don't forget it.
To travel the path to true victory, you need to be a real man.
There's no room for passivity here!
Look at the path of light... The shining road that you need to follow...
You're nothing but a passive wimp!
You'll never be able to kill me through mere self-defense.
Pocoloco's on his game!
2 BAD for you!
I'm a lucky guy! A million-to-one luck-sucking leech! Ooh! Ohh!
Trust me. Once I pass you, you'll never catch up with ol' Pocoloco here again...
Yo! Yo!
The Wrecking Ball of the Neapolis Imperial Guard - Sinistral Ataxia!
You've been chosen. A "power" somewhere picked you.
That's better. Now I feel...clean.
Be more modest!
You've been chosen... This is a miracle.
The Sesame Honey Dumpling is the trademark of Morioh Town, produced since 1906.
This is a story about lifting a curse...
You have to take the first bite in the back of your mouth. Chew it with your back teeth.
He had four, I'm sure of it. Four balls...
If you don't mind me saying so, you sure look like a "Josuke" to me!
My heart's beating really fast...
I totally hate this guy... He's such an idiot.
He was missing both of his balls... But how?
If you want the truth, then you need to go back to square one and start searching again.
In a locked room filled with an ancient stench of death... When the child opens the gate!
To free the young lion from his chains and thrust him into the future!
You will ignite your own wound and die a cruel death!
Nice to meeeet you...
Simply overwhelming! He possesses an incredibly evil vitality!!
Is this guy an idiot?! He just caught a knife with his bare hands!
Hey, bro! You sure you can make it there alone in your condition? Can you even walk?
I'm gonna kick you straight into the afterlife!
HAI...R...
Through all my 2,000-year sleep cycles, I never expected to meet a human like this... Hm. I guess humans can evolve after all.
Mooove. Move...or else...you die.
Mooove. You've been waiting to lose since the very beginning.
UOOHHHHHHHHH!!
Avdol died for you. If you hadn't been born, he might not have had to die. Heh heh heh.
When you meet your little sister in the afterlife, be sure to ask her exactly how I killed her!
I finally caught you... You're mine now!
You won't even be able to touch my Stand!
You'll never hit your mark with that speed!
When I rip your tongue out, you'll writhe—in pain!
Eleven months! I'm a genius, such a genius!
Don't you think that dying in your sleep is romantic?
Lali-hooo!
This overwhelming power! This absolute fear! It's so much fun!
It's a Stand that just keeps on eating! The more it eats, the bigger it gets. You'll never catch it!
My Stand, Yellow Temperance, has no weaknesses!
This is MY handsome face.
Do you understannnnd?!
Haha! I-I was kidding! Just kidding, Jotaro! Hahahahaha! Th-that was just a friendly little joke! An innocent little goof! C'mon, man! Sheesh! You thought I was serious?
Y-you're not going to punch me any more, right? I'm heavily injured. My nose is broken, and I'll have to use wire to reconnect my jawbone! Hahahahahahaha!!
As far as young women go...a cheerful yet ugly girl is always better than a gloomy beauty.
I'm a cosmetologist who creates "happy faces."
Now this is a face that just screams "love!"
Do your best... Your body is now invincible when it comes to love...
Pick something that fits you perfectly, like the glass shoe in Cinderella.
Give me nutrients! Give me your nutrients!!
Yuya Fungami's Highway Go Go always catches its targets!
You know, I'm just so suave and beautiful... Even if I were being humble, I'd have no choice but to call myself the spitting image of a Michelangelo sculpture. Yes, I'll do anything for this beauty of mine...
I didn't promise I'd help you fight... I just promised I'd help you track him. I already completed my job, didn't I? If I teach you any more than this, I'd be helping you fight him.
If your next paper victim happened to be one of those girls... They may be dumb, but they always come in to cheer me up... If it happened to be one of them...I would've done the same thing, dammit!
No Stand energy may enter here without my permission. I just allowed you, the host, to enter alone.
My ability lies in the world inside the mirror...where I'm safe and invincible.
Mirror Man!
Stooooop! Craaaaap, th-this virus capsule! It's gonna hit me!
But...But I managed to block his punch! I prepared myself, lost my arm, and came out of the mirror...all for nothing?!
Let's go! Grazie!
My Crush can track anyone!
Tiziano?!
Crush! Chomp! Rip his throat to shreeeeds!!
What's pushing them ahead? What is this mental fortitude that calls forth visions of hope...?
I...can't get close to you.
Your Stand...it's a close-range power type. And it only has a range of 2 to 3 meters... Now I know exactly how to kill you!!
Could it be that I've been getting closer and closer to the one I should have been seeking all along, without even realizing it?!
I won...I had won, and yet...
Loooooo-oooad. Looooad.
Be careful, now. You'll have to go back to the main building if you want to change clothes!
I can see all your strengths, you guyyyyys. Bring it on!! Fight club!!
Prisoners are the trash of society... So there's nothing that pisses me off worse than a disobedient piece of garbage like you!
I'm gonna go crazy, and make you pay! It's gonna feel so good when I make you pay! Make you pay, make you pay, I'm gonna relieve all my stress and make you pay! I'm the strongest, and I'm gonna make you pay!
You scummy prisoner!!
Jolyne, Jolyne, Jolyne! Jo-lyne!
I know I told you not to speak, but if you spoke in mousey talk, it'd be so cute that I'd have to forgive you! Like, "Toodle loo!" or "I need some cheese in my tummy!" or "Sweet dreams, squeak squeak!" OK? That's the rule!
Are we over now?! Answer me!!
It's me. How are you doing?
Come with me...
Flaccid Pancake... That which is resurrected from the depths of the abyss... Darkness, together with joy!
I'm...just so thirsty...
This smell... This fluid! It smells like a sewer!!
I wasn't thirsty! I wanted to feast on something!! I wanted to quench my thirst through feasting...on brains!!
Mew Mew. My Stand's name is Jail House Lock. I'm showing it to you in order to warn you.
The more you think about escaping, the closer death becomes.
Just run for a little bit. Then I can have them shoot you to death.
No one's ever been able to break out of my Jail House Lock!
Pfft! What are you talking about? There's no way you could see me... Now hurry up and get shot!
Mental growth is what's truly valuable!
I'm Apollo 11!!
If you intend on interfering with Father Pucchi's growth, then I will eliminate you with a burning hatred—searing like a red hot iron!!
Kid... What are you, Mr. Know-it-all?
I'll absorb your body heat from the first cervical vertebrae, right behind your neck! I've got you right in my sights!!
I will grow further! The important thing is to grow and be blessed!
So it was already done...
You were one move...too late...
Disc recovered.
This is what I was after!
Jolyne...Cujoh...
The real battle begins here... Now that Civil War's attack has been completed!
This...is the sin you took on.
I've been completely absolved.
You filthy, incompetent piece of garbage!!
"People must abandon something in order to move forward." Or would you rather "pick up something and return?"
Let's be fair here.
Sis...I want to say goodbye. I'm leaving the village for good. I'm going on a journey.
I feel sorry for you, but I don't see you as evil. After all, your entire value system is based on one thing—money.
Sand Man? That's what the whites started calling me by mistake. The proper translation would be Sound Man. In my tribe's language, I'm known as "he who creates sound."
My Stand, Silent Ways... One strike from its hardened sound is capable of splitting your entire body into nine pieces!
I don't harbor a single regret...not even a single grain of sand's worth. The only thing that concerns me is how I left my older sister alone in our homeland. I want her to find happiness...that's all I pray for.
You think I'm gonna let you get away, you pig?!
Heh! Piece of crud... That's more like it...
After we went looking for a mine inside that cursed mountain that the local Indians avoid, we found these abilities! The Indians say they bring misfortune, but they brought us happiness!
You're cooold? Now's not the time for that, Andre. You really think that's a priority right now?
Don't let up 'til the very end. And watch out for useless resistance right before they die!
Good day. I think I'll end my introduction there and explain my business. I've come here to hang you both from trees.
Then I'll just trust you. You aren't bad people, after all. If you were, then I would have already eliminated you... How does that sound?
It's over now. No need to die a wretched death... Just go in peace.
I can't take it anymore. The sins I committed... I feel like they're going to crush me...
That corpse is the only thing that can absolve my sins...
Want some? It's cold cola slowly mixed with soymilk!
I named my Stand Paper Moon King. It's origami. And the power of my heart.
Those fruits are "power"!!
There's something oozing beneath the surface in the Higashikata house...like inky black mud dripping through the floor. Did Josuke open the lid on it...and did I charge inside?!
If the light is shining down on me, then I'm going to keep moving into it!!
Eat your pancakes in a swimsuit!
In the end, you yourself are the one who's searching for your identity.
No one tells their family where they hide their adult DVDs, right? Just like how people don't show their backsides to one another. Stands are the same way...
Don't let someone just do whatever they want inside your own house...
The Higashikata family can take care of their own problems.
Everything has a natural flow to it.
Rules are made to be fair. And rules are power...
Happiness...is sharing memories with someone.
The man...the man has to be the first to say it. Not the woman...
Caaaaalifoooooorniaaaaa! It lets me take a single human memory!
Ahhh... My memories are coming back to me... Ahh!
Your king and your rook are forked... You're set up for defeat!
"I am a rock."
"I am an island."
I, Rock!
The Higashikata family...will just betray you in the end anyway...
He took so many bullets, yet he's still alive!
Th-the policeman's head... What a mess! What on earth could have possibly happened to it?!
Sir Joestar, if you would be so kind as to allow me one—just one—tiny discourtesy... You're too soft!! This villain will never stop! In his heart of hearts, he's laughing at you!
I should have exiled his father to that island when I had the chance!
Look how panicked he is. He's a total mammone!
I was riiiiiiight! Youuuuuu! Stoooooop the traaaaaaain and caaaaaaaall a doctorrrrrrrrrrrr!!
It's time for the Steel Ball Run to begin!!
At 10:00 am on Sept. 25, 1890, Steel Ball Run, the first-ever horseback race across North America, finally began.
That massive shape belongs to one of our top picks for the title, Urmd Avdol and his camel!!
And the winner of the race is: Diego Brando! Goal!!

Eyes of Heaven...a phrase that refers to the stars in the sky, when people still believed the stars were holes from which heavenly light came pouring through.
Appears in Part 7: Steel Ball Run. Stand: Civil War. Axl is an ex-soldier who was once assigned to sentry duty in a small town. Afraid that the enemy would discover him, he neglected to report in to his superiors—as a result, the enemy turned the town into a sea of flames. He was sent out to assassinate Johnny's group, but was later shot to death by his employer, Valentine.
An area in the Arizona desert. Legend has it that a shooting star fell here, destroyed everything in its path, and cursed the land. This place now has the power to draw out people's latent abilities.
A Stand that appears in Part 3: Stardust Crusaders. Its namesake comes from the god Anubis. The Stand's owner was an Egyptian swordsmith who died many years ago. After his death, his Stand fused with one of his swords and became sentient. By memorizing the movements and abilities of its opponents, it continues to grow stronger and stronger.
Appears in Part 3: Stardust Crusaders. Stand: Set. He loves to bully the weak. He used his Stand ability to transform Jean Pierre into a child, but still ended up losing and fled. Afterwards he managed to transform Jotaro into a child as well, but got knocked out by a bare-handed ORA ORA barrage, and was then promptly retired by an additional pummeling that Jotaro dished out, just in case.
Appears in Part 3: Stardust Crusaders. Stand: The Fool. Breed: Boston Terrier. The Speedwagon Foundation delivered Iggy as backup to the Joestar group immediately after they arrived in Egypt. He refuses to obey any human's orders, but only because of his proud nature. In the end, he nobly sacrificed his life to save Jean Pierre from Cool Ice.
A mask used in an ancient Aztec blood ritual. When blood touches it, several bone spikes shoot out from inside. It has the power to stimulate the wearer's brain and turn them into a vampire.
Father Pucchi's Stand, Maiden Heaven, sped up time to an infinite degree and made the world loop all the way around, full circle. During this time, all humans and living creatures in the world experienced everything that was supposed to happen in their futures, making it impossible for anyone aside from Pucchi to change their destiny.
Appears in Parte 5: Vento Aureo. Stand: Mirror Man. Illuso is one of the assassin team members who laid in wait for Giorno, Abbacchio, and Fugo in the ruins of Pompeii. After he intercepted them, Fugo's Purple Smoke infected him with a lethal virus so gruesome that it didn't even leave a corpse behind.
Appears in Part 1: Phantom Blood. One of the thugs who lurk in the Ogre Street slums of London. He attacked Jonathan along with Speedwagon and the Asian man, but was defeated. Afterwards, he was present in the steam car that Speedwagon used to visit Jonathan in the hospital, and also saw off Jonathan and Erina as they left for their honeymoon.
Appears in Part 3: Stardust Crusaders. Stand: Cream. Cool Ice is an insane servant of DIO's who would gladly lay down his life for the man. During his battle with Jean Pierre's group, he managed to kill both Avdol and Iggy. However, he was unaware that the blood he accepted from DIO had transformed his body into that of a vampire's, which allowed Jean Pierre to destroy him with sunlight.
Appears in Part 6: Stone Ocean. Stand: Planet Ripple. Father Pucchi used one of his discs to turn Viviano into a Stand user, then installed him as a guard in the Ultra High Security House Unit of the prison without giving him any knowledge of his newfound power. Viviano attacked Jolyne and managed to corner her, but she discovered a way to use his Stand ability against him and won out in the end.
Appears in Parte 5: Vento Aureo. Diavolo's other personality. He normally acts like a timid, cowardly boy, but whenever it seems like someone might find out about Diavolo's identity, he becomes enraged and violent. In his mind, Doppio believes that he's "one of the boss' devoted confidants."
Appears in Part 1: Phantom Blood. Jonathan's Hamon teacher. Through training in Tibet, Zeppeli mastered a variety of Hamon techniques. He taught Jonathan to use Hamon and accompanied him to confront Dio. After suffering a lethal wound in the battle with Tarukus, he used Deep Pass Overdrive to send life energy into Jonathan and died like a true hero.
Appears in Part 7: Steel Ball Run. An ex-member of the Royal Guard in the Kingdom of Neapolis, Wekapipo teamed up with Magent Magent in order to exterminate Gyro's group. After Gyro defeated him, he became Lucy's bodyguard and started traveling with her. Later, during the battle with the President, Diego used him as a means of escape, which obliterated his body and killed him.
Appears in Part 6: Stone Ocean. Stand: Weather Forecast. Although he's a man of few words, he's also good-natured and reliable. He teamed up with Jolyne in order to retrieve the memories that Pucchi stole from him. After finding his memory disc he engaged Father Pucchi in a fight to the death, but was defeated just before he could claim victory. On the brink of death, he used Pale Snake's ability to turn his own Stand into a disc, which he entrusted to Jolyne so she could carry on the fight.
Weather Forecast's Stand. It can control weather and air across long distances. Aside from summoning rain and creating fog, it can also produce tornadoes, make poisonous frogs fall from the sky, and cause many other calamities.
Appears in Part 6: Stone Ocean. Wes Bluemarine is Weather Forecast's real name. Mrs Bluemarine raised Wes as her own after her real son died in a car accident, even though Wes was actually Pucchi's younger brother. Later, he fell in love with Pucchi's younger sister Perla only to lose her in a tragic accident, which caused the evil Stand ability known as Heavy Weather to awaken inside him. Fearing the capabilities of Heavy Weather, Pucchi stole Wes' memories and locked him up in G.D. St. Prison.
Appears in Part 2: Battle Tendency. An island that lies 30 minutes northeast of Venice. Lisa Lisa has claimed the entire island as her home, and used it as a Hamon training ground for Joseph and Caesar.
Narancia's Stand. It looks like a propeller-driven fighter plane, and attacks using machine guns and bombs. It also has radar that allows it to track carbon dioxide. Inside the cockpit is a pilot named Smith.
A ruby-colored perfect gemstone that can trap light and refract it hundreds of millions of times before firing it like a laser. Once owned by a Roman Emperor, this "Super Aja" is capable of turning the Pillar Men into Ultimate Life Forms.
Koichi Hirose's Stand. It first appeared as an egg, which cracked apart and gave birth to the actual Stand after Koichi's battle with Tamami Kobayashi. After that, it evolved from an insect into a humanoid creature along with Koichi's mental growth. Acts 1 and 2 possess abilities based on sound, while Act 3 possesses the additional ability to add weight to matter, which gives Koichi a variety of skills to use in different circumstances.
Appears in Part 2: Battle Tendency. One of the Pillar Men. Fighting Style: Flame Mode. He is very impulsive, and cries profusely in order to keep his emotions under control. After killing Loggs, he managed to corner Joseph, who ended up defeating him. He managed to deliver the Red Stone of Aja to Sweden—where Kars was lying in wait—despite losing his body and becoming nothing more than a brain.
Appears in Part 6: Stone Ocean. A new type of creature that was born after Pucchi gave a Stand disc to some plankton. Her official name is F.F. She managed to protect Jotaro's Memory disc—which had been put inside the near-dead Anastasia—even though she was dealt fatal wounds in the battle with Pucchi. In the end, she thanked Jolyne for granting her the chance to say farewell to her friends while she still possessed her intelligence, and then passed away.
Appears in Part 1: Phantom Blood. Maiden Name: Pendleton. During her honeymoon, Dio attacked the ship on which she was a passenger. It was only thanks to Jonathan's sacrifice that she was able to escape from the ship and drift to safety. In Part 2: Battle Tendency, she appears as Joseph's grandmother.
Appears in Part 6: Stone Ocean. Stand: Smack. She met Jolyne in the G.D. St. Prison and became her friend. She's cheerful, and very compassionate. She let herself get imprisoned at G.D. St. Prison in order to avenge her older sister, and succeeded thanks to her allies' help. Afterwards, she remained by Jolyne's side and fought with her against Pucchi.
Hol Horse's Stand. It represents the fourth card of the tarot—The Emperor—and resembles a revolver. The bullets it fires are also parts of the Stand, and their trajectories can be changed at will.
Appears in Part 6: Stone Ocean. Stand: Burning Down. He has been hiding in G.D. St. Prison ever since Pucchi killed his mother. Thanks to Jolyne, he's the only one besides Pucchi who managed to survive the final battle and experience the world coming full circle. There, he used Weather Forecast's disc—entrusted to him by Jolyne—and succeeded in defeating Pucchi. Afterwards, he met people who resembled Jolyne and his other allies, and decided to go on another journey with them.
Appears in Part 3: Stardust Crusaders. Stand: Justice. Centerfold's mother. She taught DIO about his Stand and how to control it. She originally served as his advisor, but went berserk and attacked the Joestar crew after losing her son. After they defeated her, DIO lost all hope in her and killed her, but she remained his loyal servant until the very end.
Appears in Part 6: Stone Ocean. Stands: Pale Snake, Full Moon, Maiden Heaven. The resident chaplain at the G.D. St. Prison chapel. He is Weather Forecast's older twin brother, and the one who stole his memories. He wanted to learn "the way to Heaven" in order to bestow happiness upon the entire human race, and continually fought with Jolyne as she stood in his way.
Appears in Part 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable. Stand: Boys Man Man. He used his Stand's rock-paper-scissors ability to corner Rohan Kishibe, which helped his young mind grow a great deal. In the end, Rohan managed to defeat him, but didn't retire him out of respect for his mettle.
A dark world created by DIO, Gone to Heaven. Inside it a black sun shines, and black meteorites shoot across the sky. When DIO, Gone to Heaven invaded the main world, he trapped Jotaro and the others in this bizarre dimension.
Darby Elder's Stand. Represents the Egyptian god Osiris. It has the power to steal the souls of people who lose bets with Darby. It presses the stolen souls into poker chips, and the bodies of their owners become lifeless husks.
Appears in Part 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable. Stand: Chili Pepper. Akira is a young man who wants to be a rock guitarist. He stole the bow and arrow and used it to create more Stand users, mostly just for fun. After Josuke defeated him, Okuyasu hit him again—just in case—and ended up retiring him.
Appears in Part 2: Battle Tendency. One of the Pillar Men. Fighting Style: Light Mode. He created the Stone Mask in order to become the Ultimate Life Form, but needed to find the Red Stone of Aja in order to complete the transformation.

Appears in Part 3: Stardust Crusaders. Stand: Hierophant Green. He's reserved and polite, but hates taking orders more than anyone else. He became Jotaro's ally after Jotaro released him from the control of DIO's Flesh Bud. He was the first to engage in combat with DIO, and managed to figure out how The World's time-stopping ability worked, despite suffering from fatal wounds. Before he died, he entrusted this knowledge to Joseph.

Stickers that are handed out for every 100 yen spent in a purchase at the Kameyu Department Store. Also called "blue stamps." Josuke and Okuyasu used Shigechi's Harvest to collect stickers and coupons from all over town.
Appears in Part 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable. After Yoshikage Kira stole this company employee's identity, he acquired Bites the Dust, an ability that allowed him to fast forward and rewind time.

In the end, he got run over by an ambulance and died; he then got dragged into Ghost Girl Alley along with his Stand.

By placing George on top of the Holy Corpse and then shooting him with a nail bullet, Johnny received the disease instead, along with a fatal wound from his nail bullet. He died at the age of 29.
Age: Unknown. Birthplace: Unknown. A being who was born from the ground after Yoshikage Kira and Josefumi Kujo fused underneath the Wall Eyes. He's searching for his lost memories, and trying to solve the mysteries of the Higashikata family while he's at it. Yoshikage Kira, who makes up half of Josuke's body, apparently knew how to cure the strange disease that afflicts the Higashikata Family.
Age: 18. A university freshman. He's the second son of the Higashikata family, and Yasuho's childhood friend. He has intense feelings for Yasuho that she doesn't share, and she has blocked his cell phone number. At first, he didn't realize that he had a Stand, but after some thugs antagonized him on Shakedown Road, he awoke to his Stand ability, Nuts N. Bolts.

Certain objects found in stages allow you to play Revenge Battles, where you can fight enemies you've already defeated. Winning a Revenge Battle earns you more experience points than a normal battle. The more Revenge Battles you complete, the more varied your rewards will be.
Most stages that you've already visited once allow you to come and go as you please. The characters who appear in stages differ based on your progression in the story.
As you progress through the story, you'll find special Light Rifts that allow you to take part in special battles.
After completing a Mission-related battle, new Missions related to that battle will appear.
Catch the Harvests in a stage to earn Kameyu Stickers. You may also be able to find some stickers scattered around on the ground.

[Tip #2] There are barrels on Boing-Boing Cape that can be thrown. If one hits a Harvest, it'll be stunned for a certain amount of time. That's your chance to nab it!

This stage has a spacious first floor and a cramped second floor. The mansion catches fire after the battle begins, gradually limiting the available space. If you get too close to the first floor windows, zombies will hold you in place.
This stage has a large arena, an indoor area, and a second floor terrace. Anyone other than a Hamon user, a vampire, or a Pillar Man will take damage when moving across the spikes in the center.
This stage is composed of rooftops. Players will need to jump across the wide gaps between rooftops. If you fail to jump or if an enemy knocks you off the edge, you'll fall to the ground and suffer severe damage.
This stage revolves around the merry-go-round in the center. Death 13 stalks the stage and attacks characters at random.
This stage takes place near the Owson convenience store in Morioh Town. After a certain amount of time, Café opens, allowing players to recover health. Certain characters can ride the motorcycle in this stage.
This stage is wide open, but also filled with traps. If you touch the BOOM SFX (ドグオォン), you'll be knocked in a random direction. The SIZZLE (ドジュウ) and I HATE YOU SFX (大嫌いだ) deal damage, and the BOING-BOING SFX (ボヨヨォン) under the cliff allows you to return to the top, covering a lot of ground in the process.
This stage takes place in one section of the Colosseum. Soon after the battle begins, Requiem will appear and put to sleep any character who gets too close to it. Destroying the floating orbs that appear behind a random character's back will temporarily extinguish Requiem. Whoever collects the Turtle Key within the stage will be able to recover health inside Coco Large.
Two trains create the boundaries for this stage. If a character gets hit by Prosciutto's Thankful Death, they'll grow old and weak, and their attacks will slow down. Acquiring some ice within the stage will reverse the aging effects. Women are less affected by the aging. After Prosciutto is defeated, Pesci will appear and use Fisher Man to bind people.
This stage contains a spacious cafeteria, and a cramped hallway with solitary cells. If a player collects money within the stage and gives it to Guess, she'll use her Cry Cry Dolls ability to shrink an enemy team member.
After a certain amount of time passes in this stage, gravity fluctuates. Before the fluctuation, the stage is flat and easy to fight in, but after the fluctuation, scattered debris inhibits your movement. You'll take severe damage if you fall, so watch your step.
This stage has upper, middle, and lower sections, all of which are slanted. The entire stage can be seen from the house on the upper section. Miniature Frightening Monsters patrol the stage and attack anything that makes noise.
This stage has a wide open square with a dilapidated building in the center. The basement of the building acts as a shelter that restores the health of those who approach it or manage to get inside. After a certain amount of time passes, the shelter will become usable again.

How dare you! I'll never allow it!

Erina... Please, be happy...
I'll knock you until you cry like a little girl!
Trembling heart! Unrelenting heat! Engrave the beat of my blood!
I'll cleanse the world of your filth!
I will protect my father and the Joestar family!
I won't cry over burying you!
I'll bear any pain! I'll endure any trials!
You must be annihilated, Dio!
I guess that we were one and the same.
As Zeppeli said: "Think like the enemy!"
Also: "Own your fear, and your breathing will calm!"
Don't think you've won! You've made a fatal error!
Evil blood flows in you!
Your soul doesn't burn with the same fire as mine!
I'll always be here for you.
Humans can do anything as long as they have faith! We can evolve too! You'll see!
I can't believe I have to kill in order to save my soul!
You're not worthy of even uttering my noble name!
I...can't channel any Hamon...
Hey, baby! Don't tell me you're gonna fight in a risky place like that? Come on down!
Bastard! How many lives have you sucked away to heal those wounds?!
The ode to humanity is an ode to courage! Courage is humanity's very lifeblood!
Silence!
The evil—I can feel it! It's overwhelming! We've got an evil tyrant on our hands!
A flea that stands up to a massive opponent... Would you be able to call that "courage"?
This is Sendo!
Ultimate Deep Pass Overdrive!
This is my last wish, JoJo! You must fulfill it!
Popow, pow pow!
This is the sound of a successful Overdrive!
I am satisfied with my fate in life...
I feel like I gained both a best friend and a son at the same time.
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!
You did well to survive! But the "Stone Mask Man" lives as well!
Sendo and the Stone Mask are two sides of the same coin.
This guy reeks! He smells worse than vomit!
I'm the meddlesome Speedwagon!
Speedwagon withdraws coolly.
Don't try to bluff, you rich little snot!
Destiny, huh? Yeah, maybe who we meet in this world is all up to destiny...
Right now, he's completely alone! He's got no one to support him! I know I'm not the right man for the job, but I want give him something, even if it's just a little... A tiny bit of hope that'll let him go on living!!
I'm always on the sidelines... I can't do anything! Not a single thing!
It's all over now. We'll take this to our graves.
Now this is something to celebrate! You two had better find happiness together!
I'll back you up whenever you need me, and travel to the ends of the earth to aid you! But maybe I'd only be holding you back?
I thought you said losing four fingers would be nothing to you! Well?
He's been evil since the day he was born!
I've come this far! I'd have be heartless to just stand by and watch this, and that's not the kind of man I am!
That sound—the blade's hit bone! You took that head-on!!
Yeah! Bring it on, don't hold back! Let's see you go all-out!
Can I learn that Hamon thing too? I wanna try it out! Teach it to me! C'mon, I'm begging you!
Just knowing that he's still alive and well casts a black shadow over my heart, and makes me sweat like mad!
You can thank me once we've survived this battle...
If anyone lays a finger on that gentleman, they're gonna have to deal with Speedwagon!
I steal things, but he steals lives!!
Do you remember how many breads you have eaten in your life?
Weak, WEAK!!
Booze! I can't get enough!
You think you can defeat me with those slowpoke moves?!
You vile fool!
Frozen in your tracks!
If there truly exists a god that controls our fate, then having us meet up was one of his best plans yet!
I reject my humanity, JoJo!! I'm going to surpass the human race!
A cruel death awaits you!
And so, my friend's body becomes my future!
Fouler than a frog's piss!
Every last one of you will feed my undead!
I welcome you, my eternal flesh and blood!
I can even make history itself my slave!
You should have followed through...
How dare you...How dare you cut my precious face?!
I, Dio, admit that your spirit has explosive power!!
I could make you immortal too, you know!
I'll feast upon your pathetic visage!
All your hopes have collapsed into thin air!
Caesaaaaaar!
"It can't be...! JoJo!?" ...is what you'll say in shock!
Guess I did it again!
Damn meased to pleet ya!
Ain't nothing the trickster loves more than a trick!
Run, Smokey! Outta my way you rubberneckers!
This means war!
Oh no! If there's one word I hate, it's "working," and if there's another, it's "hard!"
I don't know why myself, but I gotta respect you.
Oh, crap! I'm gonna get lectured by granny Erina!
Um, err...well, you see, I, er...gave him that wallet. Yeah, that's right, Officer.
OH NO ZURA!
There anything besides air in that head of yours?
I'm a lot meaner than most people, you know!
Dammit Kars, just how rotten are you?!
Cross my arms like this, close my eyes, and grin! Instant victory smile!
I'll listen to your stupid comments after you've experienced the true beauty of Clacker Volley!
Guess all I have left now is my specialty...escape! All I can do now is run!
Knock knock! Anyone home?
Your next line will be: "How did you know about the brass knuckles, you ass?!"
Th-that was my very last Hamon... I'm all out!
Your defeat will be cold and cruel!
The last thing you'll see is the Zeppeli spirit, which will forever be passed down from one generation to the next! The spirit of humanity!
JoJo... this is my last ounce of Hamon! Take it!
Mamma mia! Okay, okay, I'm-a going!
You couldn't even beat that girl!
Gotta handle this! I won't stop until I do!
Gonna beat your ass back to the boonies!
You're a film! A photographic film!
Come, signorina, let me undo that Hamon spell for you.
Right now, my mind is back in the slums!
Let's throw down, you stupid hick!
Some of my bubbles can cleave even the wind itself...
Here's a more practical version of my grandpa's Hamon Cutter...
I'll say it once more! You can't even beat that girl!
He's lost so much blood—his mind must be getting hazy, yet he performed a masterful bluff only a pro gambler could pull off!!
That guy's Hamon is too weak! He's useless!
If you want to reach your full potential in just one month, you'd better be prepared to die!
Just try and lay a hand on me. I'll make you pay for it with your life!
You picked a bad time to test me!
I'm going to make your ugly mug even uglier!
Using your own weaknesses to your advantage? How clever of you!
Yes! That's your best bet!
What am I to make of all this? My opponents get stranger by the day!
I haven't lived this long for nothing! I don't need sympathy from some teenager!
I'll bet the Red Stone on it!
We must win! A draw is as good as a loss!
The Red Stone dies with me.
JoJo. You are not allowed to mourn Caesar, nor are you allowed to go looking for him.
You're an expert at cheating! Not sure if I should praise you for that or not, though.
All I need is this scarf!
I need to carry out my own duty.
This scarf was woven from Sathiphorosia Scarab-thread, which can fully conduct Hamon energy.
This is no time for a drink!
German Science is the best in the world!
"Courage consists not in hazarding without fear; but being resolutely minded in a just cause." - The words of the ancient Greek historian, Plutarch.
It can fire 600 armor-piercing rounds per minute!
My body! It's the pride of the German people, and the prime example of our superior German Science!
You think there's a child alive who'd be afraid of a caged grizzly at a zoo? Well there isn't!
To me, he's nothing but a mangy caveman who's lived far too long!
Bwah, WA ha ha ha!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!!
I-I still can't beat him! My equipment... Modern human technology still isn't enough to defeat him!
German medicine and pharmaceuticals are the best in the world! They can do anything!
I'm going to turn your body into a one square centimeter block of meat, just like one would pluck a chicken!
What? Wh-what? WHAT?
Take this—new anti-vampire weaponry!
Ultraviolet Radiation Beam!
Kaaaars! I can't believe I get to put an end to you! What a delight!
Get a hold of yourself! German soldiers never falter!
This airplane will be your coffin!
A god... He's become a god! We humans...we can't beat a god! We have no choice but to obey!
"When the old start to kill themselves, it means their city is on the brink of ruin."
Only the strongest warriors matter. Friendship and respect belong to true warriors!
Perhaps I've been wandering all these millennia just to meet you here.
Wamuu!
I'm expecting a magnificently nice fight from you.
Fighting Technique: Holy Sandstorm!
Very well! You are deemed worthy to be killed by the great Wamuu!
That was my first truly satisfying battle in a while.
Get stronger! Maybe then you can defeat my Holy Sandstorm!
No regrets... I'm just glad I got to see how far you've progressed.
You are just as mesmerizing and fleeting as your bubbles!
Get stronger. Then you may come at Wamuu again...
It can't be... How...is this possible...
I don't need, eyes, words, or antennae. I can sense it...through movements alone!
Fearless eyes! Impertinent words! Yes, he is tough! Those minuscule guts of his are truly tough!
Why are you so stubborn? Have your brains rotted to mush?
I call it the Wedding Ring of Death. And I'm about to attach it to one of your coronary arteries!
You're gonna burn like a candle on a birthday cake!
I can't take it anymore!
Hamon?! Please, it's all about my Vascular Needle Attack!
I hit the nail on the head, didn't I? I'm exactly right...riiiiight?!
All's fair in love and war!
Gah hah hah hah! C'mon! Take me on!
Aah, that feels good...
Despair! Now let's hear the twisted cries of torment and pain!
Erratic Blaze King Cartwheel Prison Mode!
I said MOVE, damn you! If I so much as touch you, you can say goodbye to half your body!
All this talk is just you trying to come up with a plan, right?!
Hmm...so piercing... You look much fiercer now...
I'm going to send this boiling blood into your body and turn your face into a sputtering stew!
I...I lost?! To a mere human?!
Those who greet me with an attitude like yours don't live long!
If you insist on going after it, you'd better kill me first!
Victory is everything!
Win win win! Win win win~
There can be only one!
Will you keep it up? Think you can keep. It. Up?
You Hamon users like to fight fair, huh? Then let's settle this fair and square.
My Mode is Light... Shining Sabers!
Finally... finally... I've conquered the sun!
Feast your eyes on my Hamon!
You'll be melted before you hit the bottom of the ravine!
Let me show you... The Ultimate Life Form has no equal!
I cannot allow Esidisi's efforts to go to waste!!
Santviento? He was a green child—nothing more than a guard dog! We are on a far higher level!!
So merciless... You're beautiful, Wamuu! You will be the victor! Win this, and use those humans' lives to heal your wounds!!
I'll keep my promise! One-on-one! I never intended to break it...
You see, Kars doesn't let himself get excited. Achieving his goals is always his top priority!
And that radiance! Such beauty! It's more dazzling than anything I've ever seen...
Becoming the Ultimate Life Form means absorbing the abilities of every living thing... I contain all of existence!
Hmph! Do you think me FOOL enough to fight one-on-one!?
I've still got one strategy left: Escape!
If I were a gunslinger from an old Western, I'd say, "Draw! Let's see who's the faster one!"
Gimme a break.
You're getting an ass beating from yours truly.
Do you understand?
Next time we meet, I'm gonna land a thousand strikes on that face of yours.
Even a guy like me can smell the stench of evil from miles away!
You pissed me off.
Looks like I found myself another idiot.
I stopped time...
I couldn't forget a character like you even if I wanted to. Take care of yourself...
You're such a joke I can't even think of anything to say to you!
If you keep this up...you'll die.
Don't mess with me.
I'll make sure you get what's coming to you.
It's been a while since I've seen an orthodox Stand user who doesn't rely on strategy or techniques.
Good. This is a pretty interesting game...
I didn't call for you...
Wa ha ha ha ha!
Here's your receipt!
This is an evil spirit.
How does it feel to have someone stand behind you when you can't move?
Beating the living crap out of you and finishing you off here would only leave a bad aftertaste in my soul!
When Stand users smoke even a little tobacco, the blood vessels on the tip of their nose pop out.
DIO owes me something... And I aim to get what I'm owed.
It just does whatever it wants...meaning this creature is no longer fit to live on planet earth.
I've never met a Stand this tough before... My confidence might shatter first!
You're going to get even uglier now. Well, your face will, at least...
Humans are basically creatures who destroy so they may live, but you've got the gentlest ability of them all.
Once a life ends, it never comes back... No matter what kind of Stand it possessed.
Time for a little hunting...
Focus on staying calm before you worry about speed.
I can sense both viciousness and a cool demeanor within him.
If it weren't for you, I'd be dead right now.
That's a nice watch, but I'm going to break it so you can't tell time anymore...
You did well to fight this long on your own... I'm impressed.
I hate things that are a pain in the ass... So I'm just going to bust him up.
Go on, say something to him... Give him a snappy one-liner!
True observation means seeing with your mind, not your eyes...to listen with your heart, not your ears...
Granny Suzie Q's never been angrier in her entire 61 years of marriage...
Really getting through to someone is an amazing thing, but sometimes there's a little leftover mess. That mess is called resentment.
Gimme a...break.
This is just too heavy...
I've always cherished you...
Star Platinum The World!
I can stop time for a maximum of five seconds.
It's too short! Stopping time for five seconds isn't enough...
You're not making any sense... Are you insane?
The knives are already falling!! Pucchi already threw them into the air...just like DIO once did!!
I was one move...too late...!
Tch! Tch! Yes I am! Tch! Tch!
You really thought you could defeat a fortuneteller like me in a battle of prophecies? Not in a million years...
Give me four wishes instead!
Go on, laugh! A big, fat, belly-laugh. That'll get you through anything!
Crossfire Hurricane Special!
That flesh bud was born from DIO's cells, and now it's attached itself to the boy's brain.
Magician's Red won't stand for this. Too bad for you!
Always trying to play the knight, aren't you?!
I knew I had a right to be worried! Stop overestimating yourself, Jean Pierre!
Jean Pierre! Iggy! Look out!
I'm deeply grateful for the introduction...
My Stand is called Magician's Red precisely because it can manipulate flames as it pleases!
My first wish is to make you scream out in pain!
My second wish is to make you shriek in horror!
My third wish...is to make you cry tears of regret!
Hell! Right to you! That's HELL 2U!
This is VERY bad!
Now THIS is pure Mohammed Avdol! The perfect role for my character! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Incinerate them! Magician's Red!
It hurts to go up in flames, doesn't it? Use that dagger to commit suicide if you wish.
Rero rero rero rero rero!
Jotaro! What do you think? Let's hear it!
This...is a...message...for you... It's all...I could do...
I'll have you know that Noriaki Kakyoin doesn't fall for mind games!
Take this, DIO! 20m Radius Emerald Splash!!
This'll have to do for a handshake.
Ta-dah!
No more hesitation. Prepare yourself!
I'll never return to the pathetic Kakyoin that I used to be!
With all due respect, I know myself pretty well. And I'm nobody's fool.
My silent Stand, Hierophant Green, is perfectly capable of finishing him off.
When my Hierophant rips things apart, it writhes—in euphoria!"
I don't believe it... It happened so quickly... So easily...
My final...Emerald Splash...
Please, take this. And...tell them...
Ho ha ha ha heh heh heh ha ha!
Touch it, and it fires! Hierophant's Barrier!
I've got you surrounded within a 20 meter radius! You won't be able to hide a single movement from me now!
I bet my soul on it!
Just... What happened? Did he get me? I can't move...
Go on, puke all over the place!
There's no way you could forgive this guy, RIGHT?
You didn't need to shove me!
I just LOVE coconuts.
I'm kidding! Ha ha ha ha? Just kiddiiing!
Let me just explain things as they happened! I thought I was climbing up the stairs toward him, but then all of a sudden I was at the bottom again!
Très bien! TRÈS! BIEN!
There's no time to grieve.
I will banish you to the abyss of despair.
How about that swordplay? Impressed, non?
Oh how I've waited for this! You shall be skewered!
Bravo! Oh, bravo!
I've got the worst luck with friends.
Don't have the same reaction as me!!
I don't really understand it myself, but I truly have no idea what happened to me.
I'm not afraid at all. I am filled with fighting spirit!
Allow me to teach you my name. Pierre... Jean Pierre.
I wish I could press your heart over and over again, just like a shutter button!
Anything! Anything but that!! HEEEELP!!
I feel like I'm gonna go crazy... This isn't something petty like hypnosis or super speed...
Are you an idiot?
My Stand is the Chariot, the card that represents invasion and victory!
Naive, naive, naive, naive, naive!
I'll leave the rest up to the guy down below.
I'm fine, I'm OK! You saved me...merci beaucoup.
The arrow is neither friend nor enemy! What I'm about to explain now is our only hope!
If someone with power acquires this arrow, they'll gain the power to control the minds of every living creature in existence!
I can't exit from the turtle's gem, so I decided to live inside this turtle as a ghost for a while longer.
Put the arrow in the turtle... That's where it should be, Giorno. Right in there.
That's our duty as survivors. Now...let's go to the Colosseum.
OH! MY! GOD!
My grandson's already forgotten what I look like! This is unforgivable! That damn Japanese guy, stealing my precious daughter!!
Since they appear standing next to us, I've named these visions Stands!
And there you have it! Your flesh bud's been removed, bud! Ba dum tss! Hee hee!
I'm sure of it! As sure as I am that I'll burp if I drink some cola!
Gotta relax and think. "Panic" is not in my vocabulary!
Hey, relax! I'm just kidding!
I feel like I just had an icicle shoved up my butt...
I wonder if anyone has gone through 3 plane crashes and lived to tell the tale...
Hurry! Hurry! You're about to make a grown man cry!
That bastard's head is attached to the body he stole from my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar!!
It's time you learned that as far as fighting goes, Joseph Joestar is lightyears ahead of you!
If you decide to climb a mountain, and you haven't planned a route and don't even know where the top is, you're definitely going to get lost!
I'm...no match...
Joseph Joestar. Born on September 27, 1920. Wife: Suzie Q. Hobby: Collecting comic books.
YES! YES! YES! OH MY GOD!
HOLY SHIIIT!
You lose!
What you thought was an evil spirit is actually a powerful vision created by your vital energy!
I know people say I'm young for my age...b-but after running around this much...h-how could I not be out of breath?!
Stamp loser?
I may die here...and if I die...I want you to give your mother...my best...
I wanted to look cool in front of you.
I think it's the subtlest of feelings that truly decide whether or not someone likes or dislikes you in the end...
The golden spirit that inhabits the radiance of justice... We saw it once when we went to Egypt, and now I've seen it again, in Josuke and his friends...
It's not my problem!
Grr! There's a lot I CAN do, but I CAN'T let a dog-lover just get killed!
This is NOT my lucky day!
I've gotta get them before they get me!
Sucker! I can't believe you were dumb enough to fall for that! Heh heh heh!
Fighting is the last thing I wanna do!
Guess it's time I acted like a dumb dog and feigned ignorance!
Whoaaa! I'm getting dizzy!
GRIN... Ggh.
I don't need this crap. Have a nice life.
I'll take this guy on! (Dammit!)
H-he's trying to take me out right now! What is he, crazy?! This is more than just persistence! He's a bona fide killing machine!!
I was planning to live out my life without any trouble, dammit... Guess I really screwed that one up.
Deh heh heh heh heh. Hoheh. Poh. Pahee poheh!
Dammit, that stupid bird's really pissed me off now! I've had enough of this! I'm gonna make him pay if it's the last thing I do!
I let you crush me, so that I could use the air pressure to bounce up!
The hell you asking me for?! I'm just a damn dog! What are ya, some kinda moron?!
Is having a good woman and an easy life asking too much?
I...I can't beat this guy! I can't do a thing all by myself!
Don't be No. 1, be No. 2! That's how Hol Horse rolls! Got it?!
You signed your own death warrant when you decided to take me for a fool!
"The gun is mightier than the sword." Such a genius quote!
Dying before getting to say goodbye is the lay of the land, amigo.
I'm gonna blow your brains all over the floor, Mr. DIO!
Dammit! You're actually strong?!
I'm running because I love you, baby. Forever!
My Stand's a goddamn gun! Ain't no sword I ever saw can match a bullet!
C'mon, Jean-Jean!
That's a real bad joke!
What the hell?!
N-now I finally understand, Master DIO... I should have just obeyed you to the very end... I lose...
I'm the kind of guy who fights best whenever he's partnered with someone.
Now what am I supposed to do?! What the hell do I follow this up with?!
Bluffs don't work on me.
Shoot him!
Seems like you've realized that N'doul here tracks things by sound... Heh heh heh... Not like it will change anything, though... Heh heh heh!
Let me just tell you one thing. My name is N'doul. My Stand represents the origin of the Tarot cards... Geb, one of the 9 Egyptian Glory Gods!
Trying to silence yourself now? It's far too late for that...
I know both your position and your height!
Now I have no more need to trace sound with this staff...but I'll need it when I return home.
I'm not the least bit afraid of death...
He's just so strong, profound, mighty, and beautiful... And he's the first person in the world who gave me a sense of worth.
I don't fear death. Just as long as he doesn't abandon and murder me himself.
I almost had it. Guess I didn't practice enough... Heh heh.
If I hadn't brought my water Stand back and used it to guard me, you would have already got me from behind, huh?
I've been waiting all my life to meet someone like him.
Thanks to my Stand ability, I haven't been afraid of death ever since I was a little child.
I can hear the reverberations...
I could beat anyone, and had no trouble against either criminals or killers... I wasn't even the least bit afraid of policemen, either.
He was the only person who's ever made me pray for mercy, from the bottom of my heart.
You little turds!
My chest hasn't gotten any bigger...
I'll use magnetism to pull over these power cables and electrocute you to a crisp!
You looked pretty handsome out there.
We've only just met, but I could tell from your actions that you're an intelligent man with a good sense of humor who possesses sharp judgment that comes from experience that young people simply don't have.
I even thought about making a boyfriend out of you. Heh heh heh.
Once you fall prey to Bast's magnetism, there's no escape...
You always want to touch the things you're told not to.
No, no! Unfortunately, you have to die.
I'll burn you to a crisp!
Ho ho ho ho...
Forget it. You're nothing compared to the charm of Lord DIO.
You were so sure that you had cornered me that you didn't notice that I had cornered you!
Enough already, idiot!
Heh heh heh. Make yourself at home, Joseph Joestar.
LITTLE TURD...
My Stand, Bast, is already far more powerful than you!
C-CAAAAW
SKREEEEEE
GUGAGAGA
Kshaaaaah
(GRIN)
Caaaaaw!
Grrrrr
Wheeee!
Caaaaaw!
Gyaaaaaah!
Gheeeehh!
(lick)
C-Caw
Gughehhh...
Gyaaash!
One by one, my void will destroy each and every one of you.
Wretched dog! How dare you! How dare you make me destroy something in lord DIO's image!
Avdol was crushed into tiny pieces...and died.
Jean Pierre... You didn't draw this blood. Avdol did!
Mark my words! I'm going to kill Joestar and the rest!
Now do you understand!? Well, do you!? Do you!? DO YOU!?
Sorry to disturb your slumber...
I'll defeat them all for you... I swear it!
That does it! Time to settle this once and for all, Jean Pierre!
Bastaaaaaaard!!!
You're powerless before me...
How about now?! Or now?! Or now?!
You! You're the one who enraged me so!
I have no time to waste on pain.
Whoever's reading this: Turn around, and you die.
You wretched beast! I'll stomp you to death!
This much is certain: I will find you... and I will kill you.
This is... The World!
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!
The process... The method... You think I care about that!?
WRYYYYYYYYYYYY!
You! You saw me!
If we were playing chess or shogi right now, you'd be in CHECKMATE!
It's a steamroller!
It's mixing in. Yes, this suits me well! Hu ha ha ha ha! Hu hu hu ha hu ha hu ha!
To stand on top of the world is to know no fear!
I've never felt as HIGH as this! HA HA HA HA!!
Relax. No need to be scared sick.
The sidewalk is perfectly wide enough...
Foolish human! I will rule over you! Bow before my might and intelligence!
Not that you'll be able to see or feel time actually stop...
Win, and seize control! That's it! That alone is my satisfaction!
Mmmmm! Yes! This feels so refreshing! I feel so good I could sing. Hu hu hu hu ha ha ha ha!
My head is splitting! I...I feel like I'm going to puke... Ggh... Urggh. H-how can this be...could I, DIO...be feeling ill?
Time to deliver the perfect finisher!
This is my "escape route"...
Wh-what?! How...is this possible?! It can't be! M-My leg...won't move...
Some destinies deserve to be destroyed! Some fates deserve to be vanquished! And I've already severed all of mine!!
I'm satisfied enough. Now there's no need to play with you toys anymore!
Heh... I'll give you some credit.
Stop, time! The World!!
How's that?! I've blinded you with blood! Victory is mine! Now diiieee!
All people are born with their own unique traits and characteristics. Kings have kingly traits, while cooks have cooking skills... That's just how life is.
Do you believe in gravity?
I'm on a journey to to find the right "encounter."
Great!
Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, are you?
C'mon, this is no time to daydream!
Duh, I wasn't scared of you, stupid-head! Ah crap, I sound like a little kid!
No one insults my fabulous hair!
I dunno why, really. I just suddenly thought to myself, "This isn't worth dyin' for."
I can't really put a finger on it, but something about you is kinda cool!
Repent for eternity!
This shock will be enough to blow your Stand to the moon!
If you're talkin' in your sleep, I reckon it's time I put you to bed!
This feels awesome. Like a new pair of undies on the first day of the year!
It isn't the way you think that's messed up... It's your character itself!
Just now...you said Yoshikage Kira, didn't you?!
I never let anyone speak ill of others. No matter who they are, I can't just stand by and watch!
Is this a coincidence? Or is it destiny?! This guy just let one hell of a name slip off his tongue!!
Bring out...your Deadly Queen...
Outta the way! I should still be able heal your wounds.
No problems on my end!
Please, lend me some lunch money! I forgot my change!
Some guy I've never met in my entire life suddenly tells me he's my father... Yeah, uh, okay?
Your chances of winning waved "bye bye" to you a while ago.
I'm gonna wipe that "peaceful" look right off your face.
Stop it right there! Not another damn word from you!
You're in my range, Yoshikage Kira...
Josuke here knows exactly what you're thinking!
My name is... (I guess you don't need to know, but...) ...Koichi Hirose. I'm 15.
He wouldn't know right from wrong if it kicked him in the nuts, but in a way, I admire his attitude.
You're a complete idiot! I look forward to seeing you in the afterlife!
I...I'm so happy!
I'm really getting stronger?!
But that's it! Your weakness! It's right there!
I'm not stopping the sound... Not until I hear you cry and apologize!
He looks a lot more... "normal" than I had imagined.
"Amidst the chirring of cicadas, quietness seeps into the rocks." That's from one of Basho's poems!
I told you... Don't mistake me for a small fry.
Your name...is Yoshikage Kira...
Why should I have to feel like, "I'd be so much happier if I were on the brink of diarrhea, desperate for a public toilet!" just to make it out of this alive?!
He's dead... He died standing up...
Now I'm getting even more pissed off...
H-honestly, she's frighteningly weird... I-I need to hurry up and find the courage to turn her down, or else I'm sure I'll get wrapped up in a lot of trouble!
Yukako... You can't be serious...
That's her... That unbelievably tough personality... Yeah, that's definitely Yukako!
S-H-I-T
I COULD MAKE HIM EVEN HEAVIER. WHAT IS YOUR COMMAND?
I HAVE PROTECTED YOU AS ORDERED. MY WORK IS COMPLETE.
I can't wait to get my Hand on you and wipe you out, ya dumbass!
If it's "hands-off" combat you want, The Hand can do the business! Come on!
So then I said, "I'm goin' to Morioh Town," and then I woke up. Boy, that was a helluva dream...
All this thinking is hurting my brain!
Look, I'm comin' closer! See that? TELEPORTATION! BOOYAH!
So I can surpass my older brother, huh? Thanks for the lesson, Chili Pepper.
This guy's a maniac. He'll do just about anything short of sacrificing his own life in order to gather material for his manga!
I'm going home... I feel weird. Like, something's really bugging me...
Nobody messes with Okuyasu Nijimura and lives to tell about it!
Niiiiice!
Harmony, right? "Perfect blend," right?
I feel great! Like I just woke up from 10 hours of sleep!
I don't think so! Okuyasu Nijimura's The Hand is going to wipe you out, Josuke Higashikata!
You're bringing out your Stand in front of us?! I hope you're prepared to die, punkass!
The air...the air just breathed fire!
Not even I know where the stuff I erase goes...
But I didn't get touched...I didn't...
Look at how loosened up my shoulder joints are now!
Move around all you want, you dumbass! I'm gonna flatten your Stand anyway!
If it's "hands-off" combat you want, The Hand can do the business! Come on!
Let's see how this tastes.
What a great story! What an amazing experience! I'm so very pleased!
Like hell I will!
Winning means being able to look down at your opponent like this!
Rohan Kishibe isn't gonna listen to some amateur!
Heaven's Door can open the door of your heart.
It looks positively horrendous! How can you stand to walk around with that in this day and age!?
I draw manga because I want people to read them!
I bet all my readers are going to love your shining personality!
You dare insult ME, cretin?!
It appears that my Stand, Heaven's Door, can't read my own distant memories...or my fate...
Did you think the great Rohan Kishibe draws manga just for money or praise!?
Reality is true entertainment!
I feel like you and I could get along. Don't you agree?
Oh, I've got the perfect Safety Lock for you.
I want to draw so much! I must keep drawing!
Koichi!
An unlucky "rock"!
So that people will read it. That's all. Just one simple reason, and I couldn't care less about anything else!
Oh my... Yes! This is amazing! I think I may have just come across my greatest manga idea yet!
Your memories are mine! I'm going to use them in my manga!
Listen up! The hardest thing of all is surpassing oneself!
What are you...doing? This makes no sense! This makes no sense!
What a strange and terrible feeling!
I will protect Papa and Mama from him!
I can sell it to ya for a cool 10,000 yen! Shee shee shee!
I can spot lies a mile away!
Here's a small token of kindness...since, you know...we're friends and all...
Oh, I'm such a geenyis!
Fine then, I'll give it to you the hard way! I'll give it all to you! We're friends, after all!
My Harvest is invincible!
Hey sister! I'm rolling in cash! How 'bout a date?
No one can beat my Harvest!
You keep chasing me and I'll kill you!
Wha—?! Wha—?! Wha—?! Wh-what the—?! My sandwich!!
Can you see my Harvest?!
Oh! It DOES make sense.
A-Ahem!
You're a murderer! And Reimi Sugimoto is looking for you!
You want proof? Hm?
It's not fair unless you count each one of my Stands!!
Which is it?! Do you love me, or not?! I want an answer right now!
By the way, will you...come and see me again?
You're hungry, aren't you? What would you like to eat first? Shrimp? Okay!<icon heart> Say aaaah! Aaah!
Do it, or else you won't be able to become big, strong man for me!
You poor thing, I've done some absolutely terrible things to you. I'm such a bad girl, aren't I?
I'm going to make you love me! Or else...I might kill you...
Ever since I was a child, my eyelid muscles have twitched whenever I get excited, and then I start to feel a little violent...
By the way, let me just ask you one more time... You like me, right?
I'm going to rip that piss-stained little pecker of yours right off, and yank out all your guts while I'm at it!
I like you even more now! You don't even need to pay attention to me! Just thinking about you makes me happy enough, Koichi!
K-Koichi... Instead of standing and talking like this, would you like to sit down somewhere and have a chat? Umm, if you'd like, that is...
Koichi likes me too... I can feel it now...
Why does it only last for 30 minutes?!
You little sphincter!
Our hearts are connected... Koichi's heart is flowing into mine...
If anyone damages my good looks, they'll pay dearly!
We're the perfect match!
Ahh! Someday I want to do something girly with Koichi, like eat a chocolate parfait together as we bask in the sweet, romantic atmosphere...
K-Koichi's touching my hand...I can't believe it...! KOICHI'S HAND is on top of MY HAND...!
Koichi and I are speaking to each other, heart-to-heart. This it...this is the feeling!
You're way too immature to be my groupie!
You see that? The entire town's electric grid is on my side!
Sucker! I was only pretending to freak out!
You wanna get nuts?! Let's get nuts!
Oh, what's that? You wanna leave behind a last will and testament? Better be quick about it!
Damn it, I gotta rethink my stupid ideas!
I rock harder than ever!
I'll kill your mom, too!
Behold what's in my heart: the ultimate rage!
You know you love me. <icon heart>
Gonna knock your ass out!
As soon as that old fart gets to the port, I'm gonna kill him!
Should I laugh, or yawn?! Decisions, decisions...
My dream is to become an ultra super guitarist and live a hot, action-packed life!
This guitar's body is made of Honduran mahogany from 1973, creating the highest quality sound possible. It sucks up all my sweat as I play, and the more I sweat, the better it sounds!
With steel strings, double coils are more capable of preventing noise from spreading out compared to single coils, so I prefer double coil humbuckers, since they give the guitar more power!
When I move the whammy bar like this and make my guitar squeal, it just sounds so cool!
I'll beat you with my pinky!
I demand thunderous applause from the foolish masses!
I think we're going to have a lot of fun this weekend...just the two of us...
No no no no no no no no!
I'll get away with it. You'll see.
He's wearing his socks inside out... Has he no shame?!
I'm going to blow you to smithereens! Then peaceful rest will be mine at last!
Why so down?
My Heart Attack has no weakness!
It doesn't matter what attack I use. It's your fate to be defeated here.
I've told you before: all I want is to live peacefully.
Where are you taking me...?
Before you tell anyone about me...I need to eliminate you.
Deadly Queen can turn anything it touches into a bomb...
No one can know the true identity of Yoshikage Kira...
Damn you! Why do I feel so defeated?
Now! Turn around! Hoo... You're going to turn around right now!
Everything in my sights dies.
I will survive...and live on in peace.
A gym is opening near Budougaoka High... Maybe I should join? I need to build up some stamina...
Come to my place, and I'll take very good care of you, with only the purest of intentions...
My Deadly Queen's Heart Attack never fails to eliminate its targets...
This is the first time I've been pushed so far...by the police, or anyone...
It seems that I won't be able to sleep in peace. But only for tonight!
I can't place it, but somehow I feel divine luck is always on Yoshikage Kira's side.
Your Stand felt very weak... It was as easy to catch as a pop fly.
I even feel slightly defeated...
You've found me out: I'm Yoshikage Kira. Ha ha ha ha ha! Tell whoever you like.
I cut off the part with the hands and put it up in my room. I want to cut off your hands, too.
No! I'm at my limit! I'm gonna push it!
No great joy, but no sign of deep despair, either. A quiet life, like that of a plant's...
I'm not leaving this town... ever!
You're rather cute... when your mouth is shut.
We all need to get along...and be kind to one another...
Oh how wonderful it must be to not have a care in the world.
In Japanese, the word destiny is written as "that which brings life"! Heh heh... That's exactly it.
Didn't you learn not to answer a question with a question in school?
When my nails start to grow, I become unable to suppress my feelings.
No one can suppress the disposition I was born with.
Destiny has allied itself with Yoshikage Kira!
You see, my son is being very unreasonable, so I need to educate him...
Yes. It'll only take...15 minutes. Yes...
I'm very sorry...yes. As soon as I finish...yes. I'll go right the office...yes! I'll be right over...yes.
Th-this can't be—how... There must be...some mistake... It's...too horrible...
How refreshing... It certainly feels refreshing, doesn't it?
Being cornered like this is merely a chance for me to calmly assess the situation and turn things back around...
Well, well. Did you just say my real name? Heh heh heh...
A dream... This is a dream...
Your hands... The joints and skin are so smooth...
The first time I saw it... I, well, you'll have to excuse my language, but... Heh heh...
I happened to...get aroused...
Push it... Push it. Now! Push it! Now! Push...the...switch...
You look like someone who came prepared.
Your "end" has no ending! That's the power of Golden Wind Requiem!
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream!
Once should've been enough. But I have to tell you twice? Do you have half a brain?!
In the end, only the truth survives.
That which is inherited must move toward what lies beyond!
"Know yourself...?" You think someone like you ever really can?
Only one road left for you to follow!
True preparation means cutting open a bright path through the darkest of fields!
Yeah, well, you took a punch as powerful as the ones you throw yourself. Deal with it!
Are you sure you'll be able to survive this?
Life... spring forth!
Were your actions born from truth...or merely superficial evil? Time to find out.
Sincere actions born from truth will never perish...
It's all over now... There's no road ahead for him.
And he'll never, ever reach truth... He cannot even reach the final fate ordained for him: death.
Your senses are the only thing that are going wild. Every move you make looks painfully slow...
He cannot even reach the final fate ordained for him: death.
Don't even think about following me.
There's one thing I will never allow at any cost: your escape.
Don't resist and I promise that knocking you out is the worst I'll do.
I'm Giorno Giovanna. Nice to meet you.
Ciao.
I'm telling you, it's impossible! Act like a real gangster and stop struggling!
Golden Wind is my Stand. It can put an end to anything within 2 meters!
YOU WILL NEVER REACH TRUTH!
THIS... IS REQUIEM
MUDA! MUDA MUDA MUDA! MUDAAAAH!
NOT EVEN MY MASTER, GIORNO GIOVANNA, TRULY KNOWS
This one's special. When he says he's going to do something, it's as good as done.
I'll never forgive you! You betrayed me again!
I did what I thought was right. I regret nothing.
Arrivederci! (Farewell)
Answer me. This interrogation has now become a torture!
Ah-ow! I've got this sharp pain creeping up on me. Aah. Aaaaagh!
This nauseating evil!
Worry not—everything will return to its proper form. Just as the way it should be.
Fate is a sleeping slave... We managed to release it, and now we've won.
You'd never be able to understand my soul!
Hmm, you taste of lies, Giorno Giovanna!
I can see that you're truly prepared for this!
I'll show you. I'm far more prepared than you are!
"Carry out the mission and protect our men." Think you can handle that?
Stop talking. You're not making any sense.
How about it? My skills make you shiver, no?
Using the ignorant simply for his own benefit...it's vomit-inducing evil!!
All you should be worried about is what happens after the zippers split you into pieces and scatter you all over the ground.
No matter how twisted this world may be, I will walk the path I believe in!
I'm rubbing you out... Now!
He's seriously...planning to kill me...
This is what true happiness is... This is how it should be. Don't worry...and give everyone my regards...
If we defeat the boss and go in order of talent, that makes me next in line to be in charge!
The number four always brings bad luck!
My true preparation begins here! Pistols! Show me what you're made of!
Which do you want me to use? The glasses, or the fishing line?
Why don't you kiss the road, huh? Use all that momentum you've got and give it a nice, big, wet one!
Enough, No. 3! You're making No. 5 cry!
I want to settle this here. I'm gonna shoot one straight in your mouth!
My Stand's more of the silent-killer type.
Things? They're not things! They hate it when people treat them like pets!
Uno! Due! And you're dead! Let's see you "prepare" for that!
Bullets! The point of impact is the crown of his head!
I swear I'll cut you down... with one shot!
Ahh! Be gentle, gentle! No, more gentle! Don't take off my clothes! That feels good! Ahh, no, don't!
What happened to my face?! And I stink! I stink like BO!!
My fingers are hairy!! My nails are ugly, weirdly-shaped and caked with dirt! I can't live with thiiiis!!
If they haven't made a sculpture of you yet, then you've still got some life left to live...
Hahhhh hah hahhhhh... Ukekekekekeke!
I can't guarantee you won't have another hole between your eyeballs now.
4 shots... What the hell? I only have 4 left! Why 4?! Come on!!
Come on! Quit fighting! Just get along and start chowing down!
Pass, pass, pass!
Four shots means bad, bad juju!
This guy's freakin' me out, man!
You can't load that number. Nothing good will come of it!
Come oooooon!
Aim! Aim, you idiots!
"I'm going in!" "Me too!" "Me three!"
Back down? You think I'd back down from something like this?!
Volare via!
I always carry out my orders!
Damn it! He got away!
I'm sick of this!
Heaven, hell, and heller!
Don't order me to stay! Don't!
Sooooooo what if I can't shoot?! I still have another way to kill youuuuuu!!
I'm going to school once I get back home. I'm sick of people saying I'm stupid!
Ah! I got junk in my eye! I can't see! I can't tell if you're two people or not! Nope, I can't see a thing at all!
Take this! Li'l Bomber!!
Your shopping list... I can't finish it. All the money and the stuff got burned.
A stapler! Ha ha ha! It's bound like a comic book now!
2 + 2 is 5! 3 x 3 is 8!
Yeah! That's right!
I'll kill ya! I'll straight up kill ya!
Ha ha ha! Your very name dooms you to an eternity in HELL!
You must be an idiot!
Take this! Li'l Bomber!!
You brainless pile of crap!
Oooh, you've got a little bump there. It's pretty big, too!
What happened!? Where did you hide it!?
I hope you don't mind, but I just wanted to give him some spaghetti!
Once you see my ability, you'll die.
You've lost touch with reality... Nobody gets through life on dreams alone!
You have my utmost respect!
What's wrong with you guys!? You're going to be completely cut off now!
You messing with me, punk?!
You're really something. Just do as you were taught, and you can make it happen.
Purple Smoke's virus is now spreading out through your entire body! Once it infects someone, not even I can stop it!
Take off my jacket? Here? Uh...but why?
I get what you're saying... And you're right.
Why... Have you lost your mind?! What's going on inside your head?!
All for a girl we just met two days ago, who we've barely even spoken with?!
Trish is practically a stranger to us! We don't even know what kind of MUSIC she likes!
This has nothing to do with us! We could just feign ignorance!
How could you get swept up in your emotions!?
Well... That's certainly got some flavor to it...
Is your name "Public Restroom?"
Why can I suddenly see all these bizarre things? What's going on?!
Dammit! Stay back until I get this door closed!!
Keep looking, Giorno! Find him! I can feel that he's still alive! We won't be able to rest easy until we know for sure!
I'm missing my handkerchief, so go buy me one. Oh, and get me the latest issue of Italian Vogue and a bottle of Givenchy N°2 Blush while you're at it.
I need to know the truth about my parents!
Never let go of that arrow, Giorno! We can't let the boss touch it ever again!!
Uh... Don't misunderstand!! I didn't actually touch it! The elastic part was just a little itchy!
You wear panties so tight that they make your butt look perky! That's why I got itchy, because the elastic part's too damn tight! Your bra is also smooshing your chest!
I said some weird stuff back there... I guess I just sort of panicked. It doesn't really bother me now. In fact, it kind of brings back memories...
Why am I being chased down by a father who I don't even know?!
That's Giorno's Requiem...
I can't hurry! If I hurry, I'll die!
Could you take off that jacket? Don't worry, it's not like I want to see you naked or anything.
I already figured that out...a while back...
I'm not going to get scared or run from the fate I inherited from you!!
Just who am I...?
Arrivederci! (Farewell)
I'm going to...overcome this...
WANNABEEEEEEEEEE
Being this soft means I'm even more unbreakable than diamond!
With the strength of a thousand fists!
You now have the power to make any matter in the world softer!
Spicy Lady!!
What about Trish? What my daughter says or does has nothing to do with you!
Don't come near me! Stay away!
Doppio, oh Doppio. My poor, precious Doppio...
No one must be allowed to threaten my eternal seat on the apex. I'll erase every last threat!
Giorno Giovanna... I'm not even going to give you enough time to regret the fact that you're dead!
True fear comes from the past you never knew.
Now you've pissed me off!
It's the result that counts! The result is the only thing that lives in infamy!
No one who senses my true nature can be be allowed to survive!
I, Diavolo, am emperor! Just as I always was!
Think it over again! Who is the one king worthy of holding the arrow?!
I don't know what the hell's going on, but eat this!
"Clouds in the sky get torn apart without ever realizing that they're flying!" "Not even a flame can feel itself being extinguished!"
Human growth is all about conquering one's immature past. Wouldn't you agree, Jean Pierre?!
How many times am I going to die? Where... What's going to come and attack me next?! I, I...
I can push ahead all time aside from my own!
With the future laid out before me, all I need to do is find the pitfall that pops up! As long as I avoid it, my life will never sink—I'll be able to remain on top forever!
If you've seen Emperor Crimson, it's already your time...nay, you're no longer in this world!
Those who know my true nature cannot be left alive.
You can try and erase it, but the past always has true human peace in a choke hold.
I'm...still...urgh...just...barely...ggh...a-alive...somehow...
No... I can't run away from this!! I'll lose my pride... I need to defeat them here!
I need to seal up the pitfalls that threaten me!
This a trial. I accept this as a trial to conquer my past!
Controlling the arrow is no job for a weakling!!
BRING RING RING RING RING
Ciao. Yes, Doppio speaking.
Why must I attract nothing but idiots?! Is everyone in this world an idiot?!
I'm lonely... Boss...please call me like you always do... I'm waiting...
Screw you!! Why the hell would you call me at a time like this?!
That's a wrap!
There may only be one road ahead, but with the right plan, anything's possible.
Hop in, tyke! You can trust me. I'm Irene. And he's Annakiss.
I think I get it. I think I finally understand my dad.
You need to survive! You... are "hope" itself!
Well, looks like we've reached a new dawn for the human race!
Leave me alone! I want my lawyer!
Man, give me a damn break...
ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAAA!
He saw me doing "it"... Y-you know, the word that starts with "ma"...
Alright, Anastasia. Go ahead and ask.
Of course I watch the stars. And I'll never stop until I see my father.
So we meet again... Pale Snake!! I never thought I'd be able to unmask you this way—that I'd come face to face with you again like this!
There's hope in the way you think, not darkness.
Lucky!<icon heart> Woo-hoo!
I don't have any plans to break out of prison later... I'm doing it now!
Shuddup... Don't order me around like I'm your daughter or something!
I'm going to steal three things from you!
My father's memories, the disc you stole from F.F., and your life!
If you're going to bring it... then bring it now!
How about it? Wanna join forces with me? It's your call, but don't kill anyone!
What are handcuffs for? Not to keep you from escaping! To make you submit!
Now I understand... I understand that I don't understand at all.
Okay, Anastasia. You can pop the question... And I'm not just saying that because we might die here!
I'm the one who gives out orders here.
Ready? This kick is for Gloria!
I want to cry... but I know I don't have the time to.
Here! Take my panties! Take them already!
Give me a scream... A nice, long one.
Straight down the center of his face!
Well? Wouldn't you feel really lucky?
Smack is my license...for vengeance!
This sticker? It comes from ME. It's a piece of what I am!
Glad you made it! Time to rip you apart!
You plankton punk!
Revenge is the way to settling the score with your own fate!
Oh my god!
Hey! Kid! You gonna ride this bus? Perfect! Can you make some change for me?
Why are you thinking about dying!? There's still a ton of fun, lucky stuff that might happen to you!
It's not always Monday!
When I say perfect, I mean it'd make the perfect coffin!
You think I want to live out a life where one of my family members has been thrown into the gutter, and I'm forced to forget it? Hell no! I'm prepared to do what it takes to change my life!
And the next one... And the next one too! They're all for Gloria!
Stickers come out of my hands. It's a fact. And soon, I realized... It's pretty useful.
At the end of the day, you're all you've got!
Give me your blessing! I can't get married without it!
And... RELEASE!
If I manage to survive this...I think I'll propose to Jolyne. Ha ha ha ha ha...
I dove into your body itself.
So are you gonna bring it or what?
I've had such good luck as of late... Right?
Make like a frog and hop along, loser!
I hope you're ready... Ready to regret the day you were born?!
The moment it hits, all I have to do is guard!
Please give me your daughter's hand in marriage!
She has the purest heart and intentions... They illuminated my dark heart, and saved it from the brink of ruin!
Keep moving through the marsh, until you reach the ocean!!
Adorable... Ohh... Jolyne, you're just so adorable...
First, Diver Drive receives the initial damage...
Yes... That's how it should be. Stare at me more. Those eyes... I need more...
I'm a curse on my own existence!
You're the worst kind of evil. An evil that doesn't know it's evil!
Get away from me... I'll kick you to death.
Weather Forecast manipulates weather.
Don't worry. I'll suck it up in my clouds. If you drop your undies, that is.
Just act like you don't notice...
So THAT's why you can't answer me!
I want to wash my hands, but this spout...it doesn't even have handles. I'm looking for them.
I'll cut off the highway with torrential rains, up to 30km ahead!!
You need to pee? Just go and do it in the corner.
What are your plans? I'm going after the priest too...after I break out of here.
North... Just keep heading north.
I can't possibly think of any explanation for this...
Sorry, but I don't know you people.
I can just sort of tell...from the air.
Who said you could touch me?! I'm gonna kill you!
Wanna go do something fun? Let's let off some steam!
I do feel bad for them, but deep down, I also feel some kind of satisfaction...
If she looks dumber than that tree over there, then talk to her.
Gah hah hah! Now this is a massage! Do it more on my back! Yeah!!
The only thing I live for is getting my revenge on that scumbag!
Oh maaaan... I broke that store's window...!
I can no longer suppress my anger... I'm finishing this here!
Satisfied? Perla—your sister—ended up this way because of what YOU did!
I knew it... Destiny has allied itself with me and blessed me with this trial!
My Time Acceleration has taken us to our final destination! The universe has completely looped around!
You damned brat!
By the name of God, I will smite you!
It's the bloodline of the Joestars that made me what I am!
DIO! All I need to do is awaken you, and then utilize you!
Our preparation will blow despair into oblivion! We stand now at a turning point for mankind!
I respect the first person who tried to eat a mushroom. He risked being poisoned for it!
People are defeated due to the shame in their hearts. People die for their shame.
Glory be to God! We're about to witness the birth of Heaven!
41, 43, 47... Count in prime numbers, for no one can ever divide them!
I can invert gravity based on where I'm standing.
How far will you reach? I want to join you.
Weep at your own weakness!
Destiny is what we must conquer in order to achieve human happiness...
I can feel it! This is the spot!!
I imagine it's beyond your comprehension, but I'll tell you one last time just in case: Time will accelerate.
Go on, shoot... Then I can die like a true martyr.
You will not escape! This ends here, no matter what! This karma must not be taken into the future!
A new world! The human race has reached an endpoint and entered a new dawn!
It all revolves around my body!
Stand down... You would hardly even be a trial for me.
Seems you were two seconds too late...
People must go to Heaven! Every human goal points toward it!
People meet through gravity. We meet those whom we are destined to meet!
This is the story of my first step.
Thanks. That's all I can think of to say.
Guess we should pray, huh? For safe passage across the sea.
I'll expose your secret! I'll figure out what this Spin really is!
I can't win unless I'm starving for victory.
It was such a long road. Such a long, roundabout path...
If you're in doubt, don't shoot! But I no longer have any trace of doubt in my mind!
I won't let anyone have it... I'm the only one who can settle this score!
I'm still in the red! I just want to make it to zero!
Pick it up, President Valentine.
In a situation like this, I wish I could say something all tough and cool like Gyro.
There's no way I could do that!
I need an even nobler hunger!
What a joke!
Farewell, Gyro... Farewell.
Gyro... I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I wanted to trust him... I really wanted to trust the President...
I, Johnny Joestar, am the only person in the world who understands that corpse...
Whoa! That's the craziest thing I've heard all year!
Make me believe you!
It all makes sense now, Gyro... This is what Lesson 5 was for!
Are you a "just" person?
What in the world are you doing, Gyro Zeppeli?!
Do you know what a "bug bite fetish" is? Well, they turn me on! End of story!
Yikes! That sounded really good! Too good! It's stuck in my head now! Especially the "rella rella" part!
Life, death... Who's good, and who's evil... None of that matters!
Nyo-ho!
"The long way was the best shortcut for me."
My real name...you promised... You won't tell anyone, right?
I joined this race to win! My homeland awaits me!
You have to let a horse run free. Let it gallop over the grass as nature intended!
I need to be convinced. That takes first priority!
Rella rella rella rella!
Pay your respects!
That's pretty rude of ya.
A man's world sure ain't an easy one!
Ehhh, what was it again? I forgot. Ha ha ha!
Pizza mozzarella! Pizza mozzarella! Rella rella rella rella...
I'll happily accept anything other than an illness.
Go, Johnny, go! Go!! Go!
Otherwise I won't be able to move forward! Or go anywhere! I won't even be able to search for a road to the future!
Hey...let's share our secrets here. There's gotta be something you're hiding from people, right? Let's tell each other the truth.
He'd never shoot before his opponent. He purposely let his opponent shoot first...
I'll beat you down...then beat you down again!
I swear to you! I don't know anything either!
My real name is Julius Caesar Zeppeli.
If this is how it was meant to be... I won't fight it.
Do you have to protect a king or a president? Why not a girl?
Seems like this isn't a technique, but rather, an ability.
The long way around was the best shortcut.
Next up is Lesson 5!
Filthy acts, at a reasonable price.
My soul is in clear, unclouded tandem with my actions! Everything I do is for justice!
Tah dah!
Yes! Yesss!
I'm a patriot. Everything I've done has been for the sake of my country.
It was me! I'm the one who picked up the first napkin!
So far, so good... Soon they will all be mine!
So the goddess exists... And she's on my side!
You are preventing my country from finding happiness!
I can exist in the same place in two different worlds at the same time.
This trial will end with the shedding of your blood.
Stop looking at things from just one viewpoint.
I will take no revenge. I promise you that this will be the end.
Must...escape...to the next dimension...and hide...
The pluses and the minuses always come to a balance.
The one who takes the first napkin must be respected by the masses!
It's impossible to make everyone happy.
The holy corpse has chosen VALENTINE!
What a horrifying phenomenon... The Infinite Spin energy of the Steel Balls!
You've reached the end of the line, Gyro!!
You threw an elliptical ball!
I lost... I completely lost! I couldn't possibly win now. You...are the victor...
I'm a patriot. Everything I've done has been for the sake of my country.
Don't tell me this means I'm going to be buried alive over and over again for all of eternity?!
My D4C is the only energy that can transcend the dimensional barrier!
Stop it! WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!
I'm going to teach you the meaning of the word "retire"!
(Sniff) Hmm. (Sniff) That's coffee. Smells like coffee, anyway. Is someone making coffee? It smells really good...
Want some camouflage? Do you like lamps? I mean, you won't light up or anything...
The winds of victory are at this Dio's back...
WRYYYYYYY!
This is the "line" to the world that I'm going to inherit!!
The end will come before you even stop!
Time's stopped for five seconds!
You can take that Spin...and stick it back where it came from!
The World... Time is mine and mine alone!
"You're all guilty!"
Humans are just like flocks of pigeons. If one flies right, they all fly right. People are nothing but attention-seekers who only care about their own profit and vanity!
I'll forgive the fact that my mother died for those scumbags, but I'm not going to let things end there. I'm going to attract more attention than anyone else, and rule those pigeons from the very top!
If you plan to seduce me to get me to sympathize with you, just wait until my leg heals. I'll play with you all you want. I'll drag you down as far as a woman can go, then kill you as I toy with you!
THE WORLD! Get away!! Stop tiiime!!
You wretched hicks!!
This trial will be "Subjugation and Certain Death!"
How about...Manhattan Island, in New York?
I need to kill him soon...or else he'll get a decisive lead on me!
There isn't a creature alive that has better kinetic vision than Frightening Monsters!
I think it's about time I claimed what's mine.
I'm going to cut your flesh into pieces, then line all your organs up on the ground, in order!!
Money...I want money... Simple, right?
The glory of the Steel Ball Run race is something powerful enough to influence even the British monarchy! I'll do whatever it takes to make it mine!
Who, me?
Who the hell am I? I can't remember anything...
Delicious!
I swear I'll make you answer me! Tell me! Who are you?!
I've made up my mind not to listen to anyone's crap anymore!
I am me, without a doubt! The me that's thinking right now...is definitely me!
No, sorry... I didn't really have time to look at my opponent's crotch or anything...
When my bubbles pop after touching you, they take something away from you.
Hey, Yasuho... think you can take a look at the other side?
So slippery!
ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!
The winner is...me! By a mile!
You said my king and rook were forked, but you're wrong! I just put YOU in checkmate!
I'm Josuke Higashikata (19). My name and age are both 'temporary' because I've lost my memories.
I'll place a bet... Count me in!
So you don't show your backsides to each other, eh?
I'd like to say it loud and clear, if you don't mind... Looks like I won.
The winner is...me!! My Giant Stag Beetle won!
Thank you very much!!
"'Sef"... That name you keep calling me by... Is it mine?
Teach me about my past.
Did you just say my real name? Jose...Josefumi...
Yoshikage Kira is dead.
"I was alive once before." "I lost my memories..." My body was involved in an "equal exchange," but... "What happened? Tell me..." "Who am I?"
Me?! The reason I look like this is because I know where the fruit trees are?! Is that what you're saying?!
N-Not my Yasuho... How could you?!
You're finished!
This is "Shakedown Road"... Someone's gonna get shook down.
RERORERORERORERO!
Oh, good... It's my puke!!
Pleaaase make it a little bit cheaper!
The center's always been my spot, ever since I was little... I always got to sit next to dad. I want to sit next to him!
Who in their right mind would cross a dangerous bridge like that without any guarantee?!
I didn't lose to an idiot like you...and I never will!
Oh wait, I haven't pushed the record button yet. Sorry...
What are you talking about, Josuke? Of course! You're family, after all!
Did you just say you "like Joshu"?! Ha ha ha ha! Really?! Heh heh heh heh! Yasuhooo! You finally came back to me!
It's...wet? H-has it been wet...ever since you c-called me? The whole time...?
Strip! Strip! You too, Yasuho, hurry up and strip!
What? Jo...suke? Suke? Josuke?
The first thing he did when he got to school was join the basketball club, and then everyone started bullying him—but I saved him! Then he slipped on first base, fell and hit his head... Keh keh!
I just happened to run into Yasuho at the Sesame Honey Cafe! Then, of all things, she confessed her love to me, so we went back to her house and had ourselves a love fest!
Do your beeeest, hey!
Urgh! Gross alert! Gross alert!
What an unbelievably crazy battle!
I would've won if it was judged by points!
Josuke, your nose is bleeding.
Just think to yourself, "Okay, he may as well have it."
What's wrong, JoJo? Danny won't drop that toy gun?
It's because you're trying to force it away from him, JoJo.
And you call yourself a gentleman?! With those manners?!
Dying in your son's arms...may not be...a bad way...to go...
Aah... I wish today would never end!
Erina Joestar will die by your side.
Oh my! It's simply too noble!
Jonathan Joestar's life has vanished into the void...
He will become a dark secret of history that nobody in the world ever finds out about.
The people of the world will never hear about the proud and noble life he led, but...
Eventually, his descendants will.
And the same goes for the new life within me.
These tears are tears of happiness. I'm happy that you're here.
Ohhh... But for me, it requires a cruel courage!
Gotcha, sucker!
My name is Dire!
My special move, Thunder Split Attack!
Thunder Cross Split Attack!
Heh heh... Th-the thorns of my hamon-laded rose...must burn...heh...
The zombies are piling up on the edge of town!
He's got amino acids! Cells! A low, yet noticeable body temperature! And a pulse! This guy is alive!!
Th-this is bad! He just got punched, but JoJo's the kind of guy who'll get angrier about the fact that the clothes Ms Erina bought him got stained with blood!
He's the most evolved creature on the planet now! I can't let him get loose, even if it costs me my life! Fifty years ago, this became my destiny!
You look as sad and laughable as a howling mutt who's just lost his dinner!
Jonathan's father. Jonathan. George... The men of the Joestar family have always died young...and I don't want to lose you as well!
Learn how to breathe ten times a second!
You're Suzie Q... Wait a minute! What's that on your left ring finger?!
Breathe in for ten minutes straight, then breathe out for another ten!
Hmph, I see.
Now you're gonna have to deal with me, Enyaba! Me and my Stand, the card of Justiiiiiiiice!!
Justice is a fog Stand that can control corpses!
I want you to lick that toilet clean! Lick it! Liiickkk iiit! Rero rero rero rero!
Lord...DIO...trusts in me!
In time, it'll become as easy as snapping an HB pencil in half!
Good!
I'll just take this as a reminder that you should never underestimate any kind of opponent...
I-I can't speak...or breathe! I c—hcch, cchhh...
Gambling and human relationships are the same to me. They both hinge on deception, and whoever cries first loses.
It's Darby... Never make that mistake again! My name is DARBY! Not Orby, and not Barby!
Exactly!
I'm a natural at gaming! You'll never beat me!
Don't tell me it's gonna be an ORA ORA!?
Grrrrrrrrrrr!
When you show someone your prized collection, you expect a few words of praise.
I bet...Star Platinum will attack me first with its left arm!
I'm the boss man, Tamami. You want guts? I got 'em!
I'll slap on my lock and get that guilty heart to pay its dues in a jiffy!
Hey Koichi! Let me carry your bag to school for you!
No matter who wins, I'm gonna handle things fair and square.
Stand users are drawn to other Stand users in the end.
I'm saying, what's the difference between you and me? Come on! Tell me!
I hate that Josuke guy, but I feel like I'll be able to get along with you!
There you go! Eat up!
I can't let that slide! I suggest you prepare yourself!
As you wish, io capito.
What do you think you're doing here?! You... You saw me!
The kitchen must always be clean!
My greatest joy and pleasure in life is comforting my customers and serving them my cuisine.
MESSHAH!
That killer's got to be brought to justice!
Rohan! N-No!
You need a good, hard slap to make you see the truth. You're already dead!
The time of judgment is at hand, Yoshikage Kira!
All I know is that—at the very least—it's a place where you'll never have any peace of mind...
Thank you, everyone. Farewell...
I'll never lose! I've got luck on my side!
Wanna play rock, paper, scissors?
I'm gonna tell you one more time: You're going down!
If I have to obey what you write... If my mind has no choice but to follow your orders, then...!
Once I see what makes you scared, you're mine! You'll be consumed by Misterioso's attack!
No one's immune to it. When they're scared, they give away a little telltale sign.
You know, that's really not a smart move.
"No man is free from fear."
Drink some tea...and let's have a little chat...
My Stand will solve the mystery!
Get on that bus... Yes, it's coming back to me... That's right!
Yeah, but you know, once upon a time, I had nowhere to live and no place to go, too.
I can replay all those memories!
You know, I'm a sad excuse for a man. I never finish what I start...because I always manage to screw things up along the way.
I need to go... I need to return to my allies!!
Then the deed's already done!
But the past tense "killed"—now that makes sense.
You're... gonna get... the glory...
I said you weren't qualified to be in charge before, but I take it back. I was out of line.
You still don't get it, do you, Pesci! You little mammone!
If we want glory, we need to grow!
If you're thinking, "I'm gonna kill his ass..."
What's the big deal? Every year, passenger planes crash all around the world. This'll be way simpler than that!
Pesci, Pesci, Pesci, Pesci!
Prosciuuuuuuttooo!
I get it, Prosciutto! I finally understand how prepared you were... not with your words, but with my heart!
We can't go back now!
When you've made up your mind you're gonna do something, you've gotta throw yourself headlong into it. I'm throwing myself headlong in to everything from now on!
When you start thinking about "killing", it's as good as done, right bro?
Stop hitting me, bro!
The shock is traveling along the string!
Bro! Prosciutto! I knew you were awesome, bro!
I'm gonna finish what my bro started!
Di molto, di molto bene! Excellent!
There's clearly nothing wrong with your physical condition if you can dish out a beating like that!
Yes! What a wonderful slap that was! The snap in your wrist, and the way you used your waist...
What the hell's that supposed to mean! Don't get clever with me, damn you!
You really piss me off, you know that?! How dare you try to make me look like a fool! Graah!
Nothing can keep on moving in my freezing world. Everything grinds to a halt!
Why isn't it called "Death in Venezia," huh? Whyyyy!?
You smack-talking me? Really? Me!? Speak Italian, you dope! Italiano!
Freezing temperatures can make the entire world stand still!
I could even stop a runaway train! Or a tempestuous ocean!
You really OK with that? I'm not OK with it at all...
Three? You want three lumps of sugar, you greedy little scamp?
YadaaaaaaAAAAABAAAAAAAAAA
Nothing feeds the spirit more than curiosity.
Y--You j-just said...if I d-didn't move...you wouldn't hurt me...
Green Tea! Release your mold!
Good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy!
Yes! Show it to me! Let the despair spill out onto your face!
Isn't "bella donna" a lethal poison?
What, did you think I'd be sad? You... You're nothing to me now that you've lost!
I know thaaaaat! What you, a, a...a, a, a language teacher!?
The more you hide, the more defeat will catch up to you!
I'm so, so... What was it? Not sever, not cleaver, but...
But you're WEAK! And you LOST!
I'm... Emporio.
This is the DISC Jolyne asked me to hang on toooo!
A fate worse than death awaits you.
Gravity also brings people together! You failed to leave all your karma behind!
Take this, and never let go of it... Treasure it as much as you treasure your own mother...
Help me... Ahh, help me...! My pee...it's all bloody... I'm pissing blood!!
That's what I'm talking about!
This is just me. Just me saying goodbye.
I wanna protect you.
Being alive is all about making memories...
Memories give my cells courage. That's where my "intelligence" comes from!
I can completely heal myself on my own! OK?
Look at me, Jolyne. This is my soul... This is my intelligence.
I'm the neutral party here. Look ahead!
Great misfortune is on its way here.
Don't attack me! You'll just keep missing!
The result should be obvious now...
This isn't the end for me! I have a right to be happy!
Now I finally know why my life's always been a total mess!
Just shut your mouth already!
I, Versus, am the invincible one here! There isn't anything Underworld can't do!
Are you just gonna take all that and go "Ohhhh wellll, I guess I did OK!?"
What "rules?" I *am* the damn rules!
There are no losers in this race. We're all adventurers!
And he's handsome, too!
You want to know about failure? Well, listen up! True failure means losing your pioneer spirit! It's someone not challenging themselves to overcome adversity!
Welcome...to a real man's world!
And so... we meet again.
It's called Mando. Don't forget it.
To travel the path to true victory, you need to be a real man.
There's no room for passivity here!
Look at the path of light... The shining road that you need to follow...
You're nothing but a passive wimp!
You'll never be able to kill me through mere self-defense.
Pocoloco's on his game!
2 BAD for you!
I'm a lucky guy! A million-to-one luck-sucking leech! Ooh! Ohh!
Trust me. Once I pass you, you'll never catch up with ol' Pocoloco here again...
Yo! Yo!
The Wrecking Ball of the Neapolis Imperial Guard - Sinistral Ataxia!
You've been chosen. A "power" somewhere picked you.
That's better. Now I feel...clean.
Be more modest!
You've been chosen... This is a miracle.
The Sesame Honey Dumpling is the trademark of Morioh Town, produced since 1906.
This is a story about lifting a curse...
You have to take the first bite in the back of your mouth. Chew it with your back teeth.
He had four, I'm sure of it. Four balls...
If you don't mind me saying so, you sure look like a "Josuke" to me!
My heart's beating really fast...
I totally hate this guy... He's such an idiot.
He was missing both of his balls... But how?
If you want the truth, then you need to go back to square one and start searching again.
In a locked room filled with an ancient stench of death... When the child opens the gate!
To free the young lion from his chains and thrust him into the future!
You will ignite your own wound and die a cruel death!
Nice to meeeet you...
Simply overwhelming! He possesses an incredibly evil vitality!!
Is this guy an idiot?! He just caught a knife with his bare hands!
Hey, bro! You sure you can make it there alone in your condition? Can you even walk?
I'm gonna kick you straight into the afterlife!
HAI...R...
Through all my 2,000-year sleep cycles, I never expected to meet a human like this... Hm. I guess humans can evolve after all.
Mooove. Move...or else...you die.
Mooove. You've been waiting to lose since the very beginning.
UOOHHHHHHHHH!!
Avdol died for you. If you hadn't been born, he might not have had to die. Heh heh heh.
When you meet your little sister in the afterlife, be sure to ask her exactly how I killed her!
I finally caught you... You're mine now!
You won't even be able to touch my Stand!
You'll never hit your mark with that speed!
When I rip your tongue out, you'll writhe—in pain!
Eleven months! I'm a genius, such a genius!
Don't you think that dying in your sleep is romantic?
Lali-hooo!
This overwhelming power! This absolute fear! It's so much fun!
It's a Stand that just keeps on eating! The more it eats, the bigger it gets. You'll never catch it!
My Stand, Yellow Temperance, has no weaknesses!
This is MY handsome face.
Do you understannnnd?!
Haha! I-I was kidding! Just kidding, Jotaro! Hahahahaha! Th-that was just a friendly little joke! An innocent little goof! C'mon, man! Sheesh! You thought I was serious?
Y-you're not going to punch me any more, right? I'm heavily injured. My nose is broken, and I'll have to use wire to reconnect my jawbone! Hahahahahahaha!!
As far as young women go...a cheerful yet ugly girl is always better than a gloomy beauty.
I'm a cosmetologist who creates "happy faces."
Now this is a face that just screams "love!"
Do your best... Your body is now invincible when it comes to love...
Pick something that fits you perfectly, like the glass shoe in Cinderella.
Give me nutrients! Give me your nutrients!!
Yuya Fungami's Highway Go Go always catches its targets!
You know, I'm just so suave and beautiful... Even if I were being humble, I'd have no choice but to call myself the spitting image of a Michelangelo sculpture. Yes, I'll do anything for this beauty of mine...
I didn't promise I'd help you fight... I just promised I'd help you track him. I already completed my job, didn't I? If I teach you any more than this, I'd be helping you fight him.
If your next paper victim happened to be one of those girls... They may be dumb, but they always come in to cheer me up... If it happened to be one of them...I would've done the same thing, dammit!
No Stand energy may enter here without my permission. I just allowed you, the host, to enter alone.
My ability lies in the world inside the mirror...where I'm safe and invincible.
Mirror Man!
Stooooop! Craaaaap, th-this virus capsule! It's gonna hit me!
But...But I managed to block his punch! I prepared myself, lost my arm, and came out of the mirror...all for nothing?!
Let's go! Grazie!
My Crush can track anyone!
Tiziano?!
Crush! Chomp! Rip his throat to shreeeeds!!
What's pushing them ahead? What is this mental fortitude that calls forth visions of hope...?
I...can't get close to you.
Your Stand...it's a close-range power type. And it only has a range of 2 to 3 meters... Now I know exactly how to kill you!!
Could it be that I've been getting closer and closer to the one I should have been seeking all along, without even realizing it?!
I won...I had won, and yet...
Loooooo-oooad. Looooad.
Be careful, now. You'll have to go back to the main building if you want to change clothes!
I can see all your strengths, you guyyyyys. Bring it on!! Fight club!!
Prisoners are the trash of society... So there's nothing that pisses me off worse than a disobedient piece of garbage like you!
I'm gonna go crazy, and make you pay! It's gonna feel so good when I make you pay! Make you pay, make you pay, I'm gonna relieve all my stress and make you pay! I'm the strongest, and I'm gonna make you pay!
You scummy prisoner!!
Jolyne, Jolyne, Jolyne! Jo-lyne!
I know I told you not to speak, but if you spoke in mousey talk, it'd be so cute that I'd have to forgive you! Like, "Toodle loo!" or "I need some cheese in my tummy!" or "Sweet dreams, squeak squeak!" OK? That's the rule!
Are we over now?! Answer me!!
It's me. How are you doing?
Come with me...
Flaccid Pancake... That which is resurrected from the depths of the abyss... Darkness, together with joy!
I'm...just so thirsty...
This smell... This fluid! It smells like a sewer!!
I wasn't thirsty! I wanted to feast on something!! I wanted to quench my thirst through feasting...on brains!!
Mew Mew. My Stand's name is Jail House Lock. I'm showing it to you in order to warn you.
The more you think about escaping, the closer death becomes.
Just run for a little bit. Then I can have them shoot you to death.
No one's ever been able to break out of my Jail House Lock!
Pfft! What are you talking about? There's no way you could see me... Now hurry up and get shot!
Mental growth is what's truly valuable!
I'm Apollo 11!!
If you intend on interfering with Father Pucchi's growth, then I will eliminate you with a burning hatred—searing like a red hot iron!!
Kid... What are you, Mr. Know-it-all?
I'll absorb your body heat from the first cervical vertebrae, right behind your neck! I've got you right in my sights!!
I will grow further! The important thing is to grow and be blessed!
So it was already done...
You were one move...too late...
Disc recovered.
This is what I was after!
Jolyne...Cujoh...
The real battle begins here... Now that Civil War's attack has been completed!
This...is the sin you took on.
I've been completely absolved.
You filthy, incompetent piece of garbage!!
"People must abandon something in order to move forward." Or would you rather "pick up something and return?"
Let's be fair here.
Sis...I want to say goodbye. I'm leaving the village for good. I'm going on a journey.
I feel sorry for you, but I don't see you as evil. After all, your entire value system is based on one thing—money.
Sand Man? That's what the whites started calling me by mistake. The proper translation would be Sound Man. In my tribe's language, I'm known as "he who creates sound."
My Stand, Silent Ways... One strike from its hardened sound is capable of splitting your entire body into nine pieces!
I don't harbor a single regret...not even a single grain of sand's worth. The only thing that concerns me is how I left my older sister alone in our homeland. I want her to find happiness...that's all I pray for.
You think I'm gonna let you get away, you pig?!
Heh! Piece of crud... That's more like it...
After we went looking for a mine inside that cursed mountain that the local Indians avoid, we found these abilities! The Indians say they bring misfortune, but they brought us happiness!
You're cooold? Now's not the time for that, Andre. You really think that's a priority right now?
Don't let up 'til the very end. And watch out for useless resistance right before they die!
Good day. I think I'll end my introduction there and explain my business. I've come here to hang you both from trees.
Then I'll just trust you. You aren't bad people, after all. If you were, then I would have already eliminated you... How does that sound?
It's over now. No need to die a wretched death... Just go in peace.
I can't take it anymore. The sins I committed... I feel like they're going to crush me...
That corpse is the only thing that can absolve my sins...
Want some? It's cold cola slowly mixed with soymilk!
I named my Stand Paper Moon King. It's origami. And the power of my heart.
Those fruits are "power"!!
There's something oozing beneath the surface in the Higashikata house...like inky black mud dripping through the floor. Did Josuke open the lid on it...and did I charge inside?!
If the light is shining down on me, then I'm going to keep moving into it!!
Eat your pancakes in a swimsuit!
In the end, you yourself are the one who's searching for your identity.
No one tells their family where they hide their adult DVDs, right? Just like how people don't show their backsides to one another. Stands are the same way...
Don't let someone just do whatever they want inside your own house...
The Higashikata family can take care of their own problems.
Everything has a natural flow to it.
Rules are made to be fair. And rules are power...
Happiness...is sharing memories with someone.
The man...the man has to be the first to say it. Not the woman...
Caaaaalifoooooorniaaaaa! It lets me take a single human memory!
Ahhh... My memories are coming back to me... Ahh!
Your king and your rook are forked... You're set up for defeat!
"I am a rock."
"I am an island."
I, Rock!
The Higashikata family...will just betray you in the end anyway...
He took so many bullets, yet he's still alive!
Th-the policeman's head... What a mess! What on earth could have possibly happened to it?!
Sir Joestar, if you would be so kind as to allow me one—just one—tiny discourtesy... You're too soft!! This villain will never stop! In his heart of hearts, he's laughing at you!
I should have exiled his father to that island when I had the chance!
Look how panicked he is. He's a total mammone!
I was riiiiiiight! Youuuuuu! Stoooooop the traaaaaaain and caaaaaaaall a doctorrrrrrrrrrrr!!
It's time for the Steel Ball Run to begin!!
At 10:00 am on Sept. 25, 1890, Steel Ball Run, the first-ever horseback race across North America, finally began.
That massive shape belongs to one of our top picks for the title, Urmd Avdol and his camel!!
And the winner of the race is: Diego Brando! Goal!!
Use the edge of the ring—just like sumo.
Dual Hamon!
Here comes my Hamon!
The Sickest and the Strongest
This master and student's beat will cut you deep!
Let's put the final nail in the coffin.
It's not cheating if the secret doesn't get out!
Double Bind!
Flame Rapier
Mad Dance of Sand and Swords
Surpassing Existence!
Hey, are we gonna do this, or what?
Dorara Rush x2
I really hate this guy...
Gotta be cool, at my age.
Invincible Heroine
We're best friends!
Double Arrivederci
True preparation!!
Two people, two short fuses!
I'm gonna send you flying!
We're gonna beat your ass!!
The momentum's on our side!
The perfect angle.
Rulers of Time and Gravity
GO! GO! GO!
We're friends, right?
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!
Hamon of the sun! Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!
A cruel death awaits you!
That sound—the blade's hit bone!
Ain't nothing the trickster loves more than a trick!
Burn black!
Put an end to you? I'd be delighted!
Give me a hug? Just try it.
Final Mode: Gathering Gale
Burned to a crisp!
You don't stand a chance!
How fitting! I shall cast you into the dark abyss of death with your own precious Hamon!
ORA, ORA!
20m Radius Emerald Splash
I believe you just shivered.
Crossfire Hurricane Special!
Hermit Purple and Hamon!
Serves you right!
THE WORLD!
Hol Horse is gonna kill ya!
Shoot him!
You little turds!
SKRAAAAAW
Spirit of Emptiness
I went ahead and healed your sorry ass.
I hate things that are a pain in the ass...
All this thinking is hurting my brain!
I'm really getting stronger?!
Heaven's Door
You want proof?! Here it is!
You wanna get nuts?! Let's get nuts!
Bites the Dust
I'm going to blow you to smithereens!
Looks like I'm going to have to play rough!
Your "end" has no ending!
WRYYYYYYYYYYY!
Arrivederci!
My true preparation begins here!
Volare Via
Ferocity is when you attack explosively, and then disperse like a storm...
Pinnacle of Eternity
WAAAAAAAANNABEEEEEEEEEE
I'll knock you unconscious.
Eat this! And this! And this!
I dove in.
So it was already done...
Only need one punch.
This is what I've longed for! "Maiden Heaven!"
Cloud Suit
It was such a long, roundabout path...
Ball Breaker
"Filthy acts, at a reasonable price"
This is the "line" to the world that I'm going to inherit!!
Time's stopped for five seconds!
"Soft and wet."
Wait... I'm the one doing this! Yeaaaah!!

Please back me up!
How dare you! I'll never allow it!
I'm ready for battle!
I must remain resolute!
Come at me! I'll send my Hamon coursing through you!
I'll send your evil soul screaming back to Hell!
You'll pay for this! And I'm not talking about all the horrible things you've done to me ever since you came to live with me! I don't care about myself!
You'll pay for this!
I'll knock you until you cry like a little girl!
I'll fight you no matter what you do!
Your soul doesn't burn with the same fire as mine!
For your father's sake, don't make me hurt you!
This is my responsibility... I must fight!
Have you lost your humanity as well?
As Zeppeli said: "Think like the enemy!"
Also: "Own your fear, and your breathing will calm!"
Evil blood flows in you!
C'mon! I'll take you out!
Your words are as empty as your soul!
You're not worthy of even uttering my noble name!
Give me a break. I don't have time for your bad jokes!
I'm back from hell and ready to fight!
I shall smite you!
Don't think you've won! You've made a fatal error!
Don't think you've won!
You made a mistake just now!
Who'll be the Last One Standing!
Now we'll see who emerges victorious!
How dare you! I'll never allow it!
I have a reason to fight!
I'll put an end to your evil ambitions!
I can feel the pulse of life!
Into the dustbin of history with you!
Yesssss!
You must be destroyed!
I strive to be a true gentleman! And there are times when a gentleman must be brave and fight on, even if his opponent's stronger with him, and even when he knows that all is lost!
I will protect my father and the Joestar family!
Father... Your strength... Give it to me now!
That power... I won't allow you to unleash it upon the world!
I'll fight until my own life's flame is snuffed out!
You won't get away next time! Your fate is sealed!
Father! Grant me your final power!
Don't get Erina involved in this! Anyone but her!
I left Erina without a good-bye. I can't tell her why... but I will return!
I can feel the Hamon in the wine! Flowing through the glass, through my arm, through my body, through the ground! I can feel the pulse of his life! This wine detects Hamon!
This is how it must be. I have no choice but to defeat him!
What bitter irony! Fate truly is bizarre!
I'll cut you in two with Blueford's Hamon-infused sword of Luck and Pluck!
No...not Erina...!
S-something inside me... Something vital...has snapped!
I feel a strange sort of kinship with you...
Farewell...Erina...
Lend me your strength!
Hey, baby!
Hamon is Sendo! Sendo is Hamon!
The Hamon's wave energy is just like the light waves from the sun!
The Hamon wave's energy...
...is just like the light waves from the sun!
Whoops! My finger slipped. Sorry about that!
Whew... Feels like I'm going to break a bone here!
Courage alone will never bring you victory!
You wouldn't happen to have a corkscrew, would ya?
A flea that stands up to a massive opponent... Would you be able to call that "courage"?
A flea that stands up to a massive opponent...
Would you be able to call that "courage"?
Silence!
You're still green.
Mmm! What a fine sound.
This is the sound of a successful Overdrive!
Mmm! What a fine sound. This is the sound of a successful Overdrive!
I have to destroy you at all cost!
So we finally meet!
The evil—I can feel it! It's overwhelming! We've got an evil tyrant on our hands!
The evil—I can feel it! It's overwhelming!
We've got an evil tyrant on our hands!
Leave this to me!
Let's see you make some noise.
I must fight to the end!
I suppose I'll have to take you on. But I still don't know exactly what I'm up against! What secrets could you possibly be hiding?
I suppose I'll have to take you on.
But I still don't know exactly what I'm up against!
What secrets could you possibly be hiding?
Fall to the ground, or get sent flying! Which shall it be?!
So be it! Time to settle this!
The ode to humanity is an ode to courage! Courage is humanity's very lifeblood!
Ah-choo!
Know me well...and your destiny will be changed forever.
You must always remember! Think like the enemy if you wish to defeat him!
Fear quakes your very breath! But overcome it, and you will be able to breathe properly! Hamon Breath is born from courage!!
You won't be able to breathe for a while...but no need to worry.
Can you keep it to one question at a time?
I'll show you the answer. Follow me.
Those are the basics! There are still many other ways to use this!
You may be strong, but you don't know courage! You are nothing but a flea!
You know as well as I do... You carry only a light load upon your shoulders.
Whew... No problem.
Let me tell you a little bit about my past.
This power is capable of defeating the evil that mask creates!
You have a reason to risk your life learning this!
My teacher Tonpetty's prophecy... It is something I can never tell anyone.
But how!? Does he only live to fight!? His bones should be in pieces, yet still he stands!
If this be my fate, it is my duty to accept it!
It's finally time for the prophecy to be fulfilled...
To free the young lion from his chains and thrust him into the future!
I am satisfied with my fate in life...
Courage is to know fear...and then conquer it!
Lend me a hand!
If anyone lays a finger on that gentleman, they're gonna have to deal with Speedwagon!
Let's see what you've got!
You look like a clown!
I thought you said losing four fingers would be nothing to you! Well?
That sound—the blade's hit bone! You took that head-on!!
Whoa there!
He's been evil since the day he was born!
I've come this far! I'd have be heartless to just stand by and watch this, and that's not the kind of man I am!
Judging by your face, you're dying to know who I am, so I thought I'd introduce myself...
You... You're not making any sense...
Bloody hell!
What the hell are you talking about?!
I didn't come here to play around with you!
Have you lost your marbles?!
Watch where you're stepping there!
My, look at how time flies!
Speedwagon withdraws coolly.
Tell me your name...
I'm the meddlesome Speedwagon! And I came here from the slums of London because I was worried about Mr Joestar!
Don't try to bluff!
That does it!
Hey, knock it off! If anyone lays a finger on that gentleman, they're gonna have to deal with Speedwagon!
So it's not just his appearance and his clothes. He's a bona fide gentleman! Even his mind itself is noble... I kinda like this guy!
Destiny, huh? Yeah, maybe who we meet in this world is all up to destiny...
I don't think anything's ever going to surprise me again!
Watch out!
I've got a big smile on my face!
We finally did it!
It may sound like an exaggeration, but we saved the world!
Whoa there!
Careful! Watch where you're stepping there!
Sorry, sorry! Heh heh heh!
Now!
I, Dio, will kill you!
Yes! I feel ripe with power! What ecstasy!
Yes! This new power is such a rush!
All your hopes have collapsed into thin air!
I can even make history itself my slave!
You're no match for Dio's Vaporizing Freeze!
Worthless scum!
Hmph! Idiot.
I'll smash you to dust!
Need another beating?!
I'll send you to Hell!
I'm surpassing humanity!
I'm surpassing humanity... With your very blood!
Don't bother resisting!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Shed tears of joy, you fool!
Don't get confident yet, you little worm.
You fool! I'll crush your skull like an eggshell!
Okay! Okay!
You shall be food for the pigs!
Wooooryyyyyaaahhh!!
Don't get cocky! Kuaa!
I'll feast upon your pathetic visage!
You should have followed through...
I welcome you, my eternal flesh and blood!
Hmph! With this mask, I can easily kill you or make you my slave!
I am at the peak of all creation... A new life form, sent to forge a new future!
You think I'd ever step down to the same level as a mere human!? What insolence!
Weak, WEAK! Did you think you ever stood a chance?! Idiot!
Struggle all you want! You'll find there are limits to your human body!
I reject my humanity! JoJo!
I have surpassed humanity!
Rework your strategy all you want. There is a limit to what you humans can do.
I've surpassed humanity! It's already been proven that no mere human could possibly defeat me, Dio! With immortality and eternal life, I now have the power to conquer the world!
You and I are the elite among the evil out there! Care to become my slave?
Remember that thing called the food chain? Pigs eat grass, then humans eat pigs. But we eat the humans... Humans are our prey, and that makes us the true emperors! Hu hah hah hah!
I'll enslave evil since they're so easy to use, then I'll conquer this town, then London, then the world! The entire world will be in the palm of my hand, and I will rule the human race!
Hmph... This battle's over.
So you have chosen tragedy for yourself...
A life without manners is a life without value!
Now I'll just insert a bit of my vampire extract in here to mingle with your lifeblood!
Can a monkey match a human? No! And to me, you're nothing but a monkey!
I will live on! Eternally! And nothing can stop me!
Don't fail me now!
I'll wipe the floor with you!
Damn meased to pleet ya!
Hmm, now how should I pick on ya?
OH NO ZURA!
You calling me stupid, punk?!
That's the spirit.
Don't play dumb with me, damn it!
I'll rip you apart.
Knock knock! Anyone home?
Helloooo?
The hell? C'mon, man!
I'm a lot meaner than most people, you know!
Howdy! How ya feelin'?
My Hamon's gonna rip right through you!
Quit screwing with me, dammit!
I'll grind you to dust!
You stupid hick!
Hmmm!
Now I'm serious...
Huh? What'd you say? I don't speak idiot.
There anything besides air in that head of yours?
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Woo-hoo!
Gah hah hah hah!
Yeah, that's it! Get really pissed!
I'm ready for you!
It's already lost for you!
Just how rotten are you!?
If this is fate, I will follow it where it goes!
Your way of thinking is all wigged out, but damn if I don't respect you!
I gotta say, I'm touched by your sense of pride!
Guess I did it again!
You gotta get up pretty early in the morning to trick the trickster!
Ah! Guess I just got lost in the moment back there.
Don't you see? I know exactly how your simple mind works!
I need to make Grandma Erina happy. That's it and that's all!
You can sleep in peace starting tonight, Grandma.
Thanks for the training, master!
I appreciate it... Grazie!
This is how a modern man fights!
I'll have to think of another strategy now. Gimme a break!
How come lately nothing cool seems to happen to me?
Your vitality is the one thing I'll applaud!
"Victory is fully decided before the battle starts." So says Sun Tzu!
Ain't nothing the trickster loves more than a trick!
Your spirit will live on in me!
Oh, whoops. That was probably a bit mean of me!
Ooops, guess I did it again!
I really will do whatever it takes to survive...
Guess I really am of the Joestar bloodline...
JoJo always has a plan!
Be a dear, would you?
I'll wipe the floor with you!
Damn meased to pleet ya!
Hmm, now how should I pick on ya?
OH NO ZURA!
You calling me stupid, punk?!
That's the spirit.
Don't play dumb with me, damn it!
I'll rip you apart.
Knock knock! Anyone home?
Helloooo?
The hell? C'mon, man!
I'm a lot meaner than most people, you know!
Howdy! How ya feelin'?

Ready for this?
Your defeat will be cold and cruel!
Man, what a disappointment.
Let's throw down, you stupid hick!
I'll finish the rest!!
Gotta handle this! I won't stop until I do!
I won't be able to rest until you're a mess on the ground!
Ooh, not so fast!
Yet another hick from the sticks, huh?
You're starting to piss me off, you ass!
You're useless!
You couldn't even beat that girl!
Hmph! How d'you like that?
You bum!
Pathetic!
You! What're you screwing with me for?! Are you even taking this seriously?!
You! What're you screwing with me for?!
Are you even taking this seriously?!
Just sit down!
You haven't got a clue!
Show some respect, or you'll be sorry!
What're you scared for?!
Lost your nerve?!
I thought you, of all people, would understand. What a disappointment!
Nngh! Quit messing around!
Some of my bubbles can cleave even the wind itself...
Here's a more practical version of my grandpa's Hamon Cutter...
Some bubbles can cut through wind... Here's my grandpa's more practical version of the Hamon Cutter: Bubble Cutter!!
Bubble Cutter!
Mamma mia!
We Italians care for our family more than anything! Across every generation!
Right now, my mind is back in the slums!
Nothing can break my Hamon, or my spinning, saucer-like Bubble Cutter!
My spirit is honed... I feel every change in the wind! Just as I did in the slums!
I have a technique that'll easily be able to kill those Pillar Men!
My gloves and costume are all filled with the special soap I need for my bubbles!
Have fun flopping around like a fish out of water!
I hate sloppy bastards like you.
My friend was murdered! You think I care about a measly eye?!
"The smaller the hole in the water gun, the farther it'll shoot!" Got it, moron?!
You're pretty damn stubborn, you know that?!
How disappointing. Guess you really were as stupid as you looked.
JoJo and I won't be bested by the likes of those three!
I'm not in a hurry! I'm here to settle this! This is my chance to get revenge for my grandfather, who died because of that Stone Mask! I'm going to rip him apart!!
I'm going!
This is a family matter!
I know this is a trap. In fact, that's exactly why I'm here.
I'm a Zeppeli. Their proud blood flows in my veins.
I have to do something. Otherwise I'll never live it down!
Here I come!
You picked a bad time to test me!
I'll bet the Red Stone on it!
Luck? What luck...?
I'm heading straight to the final battle!
What are you so confused about?
I'm going to make your ugly mug even uglier!
Your training has already begun...
Using your own weaknesses to your advantage? How clever of you!
You're still on your feet?
That's the way it goes...
The Red Stone dies with me.
There's no time for talk.
Nothing more to discuss.
What are you doing!?
My, how clever of you!
Ha ha ha ha!
You're an expert at cheating! Not sure if I should praise you for that or not, though.
Give me all you've got!
I'll never let them get their hands on the Red Stone! It's my duty to protect it!
A crystal forged by nature without even a hint of impurity! Super Aja!
What a relief!
I haven't lived this long for nothing!
Pass my trial or get out of my sight.
Three Hamon warriors died during this war for the red stone, but I've still managed to protect it all the while—for that is my duty!
In order to keep the Red Stone out of their hands, we're going to have to do some pretty dirty things!
There's no telling what may happen to me from here on out.
I don't know how to feel at times, but ultimately, fate is what it is.
Yes! That's your best bet!
People who never give up are allowed to be ambitious!
So that's why I felt no bloodlust... You never planned to fight, from the very beginning...
JoJo...
Inhale for 10 minutes! Exhale for 10 minutes!
Need backup!
German medicine and pharmaceuticals are the best in the world! They can do anything!
This is no time for a drink!
I'm going to turn your body into a one square centimeter block of meat, just like one would pluck a chicken!
Bwah, WA ha ha ha!
Get a hold of yourself! German soldiers never falter!
I'm prepared to blow myself away with you!
Courage consists not in hazarding without fear; but being resolutely minded in a just cause!
Exterminate everyone aside from this one person!
Despite how I may look, I'm still a proud German soldier!
Even I can do something like that!
Now repairing...
Make sure it doesn't hurt. Be gentle!
That really hit the spot...
Long live our homeland!
German Science is the best in the world!
You owe your life to Stroheim now!
Whoaaaaa!
"Courage consists not in hazarding without fear; but being resolutely minded in a just cause." - The words of the ancient Greek historian, Plutarch!
Let's team up here...
So fast! You found out in only several hours that your ally was defeated in Venetia, and that we gained possession of the Red Stone... And now you've come to steal it back...
My men died without uttering a single cry.
And now, my German UV Radiation Beam will finish you!
Shall we team up?
Wamuu!
You have a 0％ chance of survival.
Heh heh... No matter what you try, it's all accounted for in my strategy.
Ha ha ha ha!
This is the end.
You people always say the same thing.
(GRIN)
This is getting interesting.
Fight me if you wish. I will grant you that time.
Show me your warrior's spirit!
Show me more!
Good battle sense.
Coward.
Puny as you are, your courage is impressive.
I'm expecting a magnificently nice fight from you.
Grab the "Wind"!
Do not disgrace this duel in front of me!
Impossible!
Fight me!
Pathetic.
Too slow!
Get stronger. Then you may come at Wamuu again...
Behold my Holy Sandstorm!
Get stronger! Maybe then you can defeat my Holy Sandstorm!
Heh heh. You've grown strong.
I, Wamuu, never like giving my foes an easy victory!
You humans don't live long anyway. Why hurry yourself to your final fate?
Nngh! You're still alive!
Why are you so stubborn? Have your brains rotted to mush?
Very well! I'll grant you your life for another month!
That was my first truly satisfying battle in a while.
Enough! This fight is finished!
There is no saving you now!
Farewell. Your life is over now.
I will keep you in a corner of my memory for eternity.
All I have done is follow my own credo...
Perhaps I've been wandering all these millennia just to meet you here.
Help me out!
Oh, you look pale... I hit the nail on the head, didn't I? I'm exactly right...riiiiight?!
You just got scared of me, didn't you?
Oh, you look pale... I hit the nail on the head, didn't I?
Those who meet me with an attitude like yours don't live long!
All's fair in love and war!
I'm exactly right...riiiiight?!
How long can you escape my Mode!?
What do you think you're doing?!
Heh heh heh heh heh!
Here's a present from me.
The antidote is right here, in my nose ring!
I have no time to deal with the likes of you right now.
Hmm...so piercing... You look much fiercer now...
A clever dodge indeed...
All this talk is just you trying to come up with a plan, right?!
Riiiight!?
I knew you were scared.
Heh heh heh heh!
Don't worry: Your life is in my hands, now!
Has your fear driven you mad yet?
Your chase ends here!
If you insist on going after it, you'd better kill me first!
Gah hah hah hah! C'mon! Take me on!
Try and kill me!
Enough with the stupid bluffing!
Almost there! Once the Red Stone of Aja is placed here, the Stone Mask is complete!
I think I'll go and see how the outside world has changed over the years!
You're a long way away from being ready to fight me.
I supposed you planned to flee from here. So much for that, right?
I can already see right through your plans!
Now I'm alone...? I guess Kars and the rest don't realize the Red Stone is still nearby.
I said MOVE, damn you! If I so much as touch you, you can say goodbye to half your body!
How unexpected... I ran into a surprising person in a surprising place!
I'm a bit surprised at how much you've grown...
Your arms will be taken in by my body!
I'm a little more passionate than Kars or Wamuu. I have to cry my eyes out to chill out!
To fight is to deceive! Enraging your opponent and upsetting them will create openings! That's exactly what you're trying to do, isn't it? Too bad I won't fall for it...
Your improvement is indeed praise-worthy! I haven't had a good rival in ages.
I knew you were scared. Your unrest made you panic...and your attacks became far more simplistic than mine.
My hot blood will flow into you and turn your face into a bubbling stew!
"Victory is fully decided before the battle starts." Isn't that right?!
It really—! Really, really, really, really, really...really happened exactly the way you said it would!!
It looks like my strategy beats yours! That's all victory really means!
Time to strike!
Stop there! Time to die!
Time to pluck the life out of you like a flower from a field!
Ha ha ha ha ha! You've certainly got guts!
Mmmm... What a scream! Listen to it echo! That's what I want to hear from you, JoJo!
Mmmm... What a scream! Listen to it echo!
What a scream... That's what I want to hear!
Hmm? Did you say something?
Humans are not as they once were.
Wanna take me on?
You won't get off so easy!
I'll dispose of you!
Heh heh. Think you can pull it off?
I'm not letting you leave here alive!
You've got guts...
You fool...
Hmph! Close, close!
Kars will pour every last ounce of strength he has into killing you!
Now I won't be satisfied unless I beat you fair and square!
Can you keep it up? Are you going to keep? It? Up?
Think you're so clever...
Slowly but surely, you will fall into my hands and die...
Winwinwin, win win~
You know what that is? That's just pure desperation!
Heh heh heh heh...
You're like a butterfly in a spider's web!
You damned fools!
Save the hard work and danger for someone else! Let your pawns do the dirty work! That's how you fight!
That beautiful shine! More wonderful than ever... Finally... I've conquered the sun!
My Mode is Light... Shining Sabers!
Well done, you fought to the bitter end. Too bad your power didn't last out!
I don't seek to become a warrior like Wamuu, but neither am I a romanticist. I'll do whatever it takes, because in the end...victory is everything!!
Humans are not as they once were.
Over already? Feh.
Idiot... Don't you see?
Just kill yourself. That's the best medicine for a peaceful death!
You're far too innocent to be a fighter! That's why you're so weak!
One-on-one battle? Bah! All I want is the Red Stone, to become the ultimate life form!
Now! All of you! Destroy that annoying pest!
Cunning as always, aren't you? Can't take my eyes off you for a second!
Becoming the Ultimate Life Form means absorbing the abilities of every living thing... I contain all of existence!
Now, to settle things with you, and only you! As a way to celebrate the birth of the new Kars!
Yes! That was Hamon, you fool! Now that I've surpassed the sun, there isn't anything I can't do! Stupid primate!
Hmm... Nice response.
RRRRRYY!
Join me on this one!
Piss off.
I'll be the judge!
I didn't call for you...
Sweet dreams... in hell!
What's the problem?
Wa ha ha ha ha!
You asked for it!
You gotta be kidding me.
Can't hear you!
You mad?
Not gonna work.
Hold it!
Doesn't matter if you come at me or not. You're getting a beating.
Bet I'm stronger.
Remember: You're gonna be paying for this.
My, my.
Piss off.
Good. This is a pretty interesting game...
I'll take you down.
Damn it. Now it's getting interesting.
How's it feel?
Better give up.
Gimme a break.
Do you understand?
You gotta carve out your own path in life.
Piss off.
Your tab can only be paid with beatings!
Even a guy like me can smell the stench of evil from miles away!
Looks like I found myself another idiot.
I'm the kind of guy who keeps a grudge if someone screws with me.
It's hard to see who you really are from your own perspective...
You're such a joke I can't even think of anything to say to you.
Nice, nice...
Didn't you study up on us at all?
Now, promise we'll never have to look at your ugly mug ever again.
Next time we meet, I'm gonna land a thousand strikes on that face of yours.
You were pretty strong...
You're pretty strong.
Good.
It's not cheating if you don't get caught.
This isn't enough... I'm still not angry enough!
I don't have any pity. Not for you.
MUDA this, MUDA that. I'm sick of hearing that things are "impossible." That ain't in our vocabulary.
There's only one reason you lost...just one simple reason. You pissed me off.
There's only one reason you lost...
Do you understand?
Don't worry... I'm going easy on you here.
Join me on this one!
I'll be the judge!
I didn't call for you...
Sweet dreams... in hell!
Well? What's wrong?
Wa ha ha ha ha!
Ass...
Now you've done it...
C'mon, tough guy.
Carefully watch your opponent's movements, okay?
I'm going to break you into pieces.
You asked for it!
You gotta be kidding me.
Can't hear you!
You mad?
Not gonna work.
Hold it!
Doesn't matter if you come at me or not. You're getting a beating.
Bet I'm stronger.
Remember: You're gonna be paying for this.
My, my.
Piss off.
Good. This is a pretty interesting game...
I'll take you down.
Damn it. Now it's getting interesting.
How's it feel?
Better give up.
Gimme a break.
Do you understand?
You gotta carve out your own path in life.
Piss off.
Your tab can only be paid with beatings!
You reap what you sow.
Hmm. Not bad, I guess. A solid 85.
That ability of yours is really dangerous... Don't get pissed off and lose control of it, okay?
Gimme a break. Can I finally take a breather now?
Even a guy like me can smell the stench of evil from miles away!
Looks like I found myself another idiot.
I'm the kind of guy who keeps a grudge if someone screws with me.
It's hard to see who you really are from your own perspective...
You're such a joke I can't even think of anything to say to you.
Nice, nice...
Didn't you study up on us at all?
Now, promise we'll never have to look at your ugly mug ever again.
Next time we meet, I'm gonna land a thousand strikes on that face of yours.
You were pretty strong...
You're pretty strong.
Good.
It's not cheating if you don't get caught.
This isn't enough... I'm still not angry enough!
I don't have any pity. Not for you.
MUDA this, MUDA that. I'm sick of hearing that things are "impossible." That ain't in our vocabulary.
There's only one reason you lost...just one simple reason. You pissed me off.
There's only one reason you lost...
Do you understand?
Don't worry... I'm going easy on you here.
Piss off.
Piss off.
Here goes!
Time for your punishment, baby.
Rero rero rero rero rero!
You'll atone with your own death!
Ho ha ha ha heh heh heh ha ha!
Gotcha!<icon heart>
You awakened me. That's all.
...You woke me up.
My silent Stand, Hierophant Green, is perfectly capable of finishing him off.
You sure have rapid mood swings, huh?
Pfft!
You're something else.
Damn you!
What a winner you are.
Aheheheh...
Guess I'll have to resort to more drastic measures!
Stop your foolish resisting, or I'll break your neck...
I'll break your neck...
Weird. Made a mistake, huh?
I see London, I see France!
I don't like this, either!
Your over-politeness is starting to annoy me.
You're starting to annoy me.
You make me want to puke.
A scumbag trying to play the gentleman!
You make me sick. A scumbag trying to play the gentleman!
I'm fine. I can do this.
I bet my soul on it!
Quit the gentleman act!
I don't need to answer you.
I'll have you know that Noriaki Kakyoin doesn't fall for mind games!
I don't fall for mind games!
What do YOU think?
Damn it! I can't lose again!
I can't lose again!
When my Hierophant rips things apart, it writhes—in euphoria!"
You know far too little about your foe. Better study more.
Don't come near us again... or else I'll need to punish you.
After those "flesh buds" DIO put in me 6 months ago, nothing can scare me anymore!
I'll never return to the pathetic Kakyoin that I used to be!
It's sad to see you stand up, like a punching bag in front of a boxer. All that effort, just to get punched some more...
You're rotten to the core.
With all due respect, I know myself pretty well. And I'm nobody's fool.
Well? Ready to be retired?
Didn't you ask anyone about me?! I can uncoil Hierophant into a long string.
Now you can evade your pursuers. If you're lucky.
You're knocked out... But your wounds are light.
Oh...I see. Guess nobody else knows, huh?
I can tell that you're more intense than any opponent I've ever faced before! Like hearing an engine and knowing immediately that it's a bulldozer!
I'll make it so that no one will notice it, just like in the old days!
Mom, Dad, what are you doing right now? Are you already asleep? I'm sorry for causing you so much worry...
Time to dice you up!
I will banish you to the abyss of despair.
Hey! I told you to stop!
Are you an idiot?
You scoundrel!
Hey, you're not gonna believe this!
You gotta FEEL it out!
My Stand will give you your just reward!
Time to give you your just reward!
Mean to kill moi, do you?
You rotten, festering filth!
Hey, you bumpkin!
Hmm? Something funny?
You're such a pain.
So we finally meet.
Death penalty!
You lunatic!
I'll kill you!
Ridiculous.
You! What do you think you're doing?!
Let me show you hell!
Yeaaah!
You sure got balls, don't you?
Do something, huh?!
C'mon! I'm right here! What's the matter?
I'm not afraid at all. I am filled with fighting spirit!
Right now, I'm not the least bit afraid.
There's nothing inside me but fighting spirit!
Move, moron!
Bravo! Oh, bravo!
The devil won't get the honor of doing you in! I'm gonna skewer you right here! I've been waiting years for this moment!
Love is more important than wealth or fame!
Make me a manga artist! I always wanted to be one! Make sure I'm really popular, too, so I can build J. P. Land!
We're travelers here... and we need to get going to the next town.
Go to Hell.
Well, that was disappointing.
I'll leave the rest up to the guy down below.
There's no time to grieve.
Ororoooon!
Leaving me out...sniff...
Uh...no comment! Don't look! All your teeth are busted anyways!
Escape is the one thing I'll never do!
You aren't dead... but with those wounds, you've certainly been retired!
You're a troublesome one!
I've got the worst luck with friends.
I'm always like this. I don't know what I have until it's gone.
Yeah, I'm hurting a bit, but there's no time for crying!
Let me just explain things as they happened!
Let's do this together!
Tch! Tch! Yes I am! Tch! Tch!
Hell! Right to you! That's HELL 2U!
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Incinerate them! Magician's Red!
Laugh! Laugh! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Impressive!
Not in a million years...
What a sight.
Well? Go ahead.
Impossible? I'd like to see about that.
You know what they say: Many go out for wool and come home shorn!
You pompous fool!
Stop overestimating yourself!
You started this! I'm gonna make you keep your promise!
I'm gonna make you keep your promise!
I'm afraid you won't be going home in one piece.
You won't be going home in one piece.
Like Aesop wrote: A man can put on clothing against the cold, but heat conquers all.
I would appreciate it if you stopped thinking of my flames as conventional ones that always burn upwards, or downwind... My Stand is called Magician's Red precisely because it can manipulate flames as it pleases!
This is a variation on my Cross Fire Hurricane, which allows its ankh-shaped flame to split into different parts!
Magician's Red won't stand for this... Too bad for you.
Now THIS is pure Mohammed Avdol! The perfect role for my character! Ha ha ha ha ha!
You probably won't stand up for another three months.
I told you... I can split up my flame and shoot it any way I like!
Always trying to play the knight, aren't you?!
It'd be a shame to have to kill you! Something's up with you... I can feel it.
Say hi to DIO for me, loser!
Such fearsome power... Like nothing I've seen before!
This is just what I need! This is it!
I knew I had a right to be worried!
Better give DIO and his pals the bad news: Mohammed Avdol is still alive.
I didn't bust out my full power there. My back still isn't fully healed yet from my battle with the Hanged Man.
Oh, I'm fine. I just feel a bit of a twinge.
Gotta admit, I'm glad you're on my side. I don't think I could beat you!
All this running around is making me hungry.
My flame detects no other life forms nearby.
Woof woof!
Om nom nom!
Grrr! Grrr!
Grrr!
Bark!
BARK!
Bark bark bark bark!
Whimper!
Bark bark bark bark bark!
Bark! (Whimper!)
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Awwwr
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Grrr... Woof! Woof!
Fighting is the last thing I wanna do!
Is having a good woman and an easy life asking too much?
You're one crazy mofo, you know that?!
Hmph... No one orders ME around!
This has got nothing to do with me! So long!
Don't look at me. It's not my problem!
The hell you asking me for?! I'm just a damn dog! What are ya, some kinda moron?!
I couldn't give a rat's ass about this...
I don't need this crap. Have a nice life.
Grr! There's a lot I CAN do, but I CAN'T let a dog-lover just get killed!
Sucker! I can't believe you were dumb enough to fall for that! Heh heh heh!
This is NOT my lucky day!
Let's go!
As far as fighting goes, I'm light years ahead of you!
OH! MY! GOD!
I'm light years ahead of you!
Wa hah hah hah hah!
Have my years made me hard of hearing or something?
I missed what you just said.
Mind saying that again?
Keep up the good fight!
YES! YES! YES! OH MY GOD!
YES! YES! YES!
Damn you!
Shut up!
In terms of fighting, I'm lightyears ahead of you!
Eh? What'd you say?
It's no use.
Ka ha ha ha!
I'll make you eat your words!
OH! GOD!
SON OF A BITCH!
HOLY SHIIIT!
OH MY GOOOOOOD!
HOLY SHIT!
You lose!
My bad!
I'll at least let you live.
Time to take out the trash!
Gotta relax and think. "Panic" is not in my vocabulary!
Calm down... Calm down and think.
Panic isn't in my vocabulary
I'll find something... Some way to get through!
I need some way to get through...
What's wrong? Why won't you hit me?
See what I mean about being lightyears ahead of you?
"When your opponent starts boasting, he's already lost." A little Joseph Joestar wisdom for you! And it only rings truer with age!
Never forget my Hermit Purple!
Let's head northwest!
Ha ha ha ha ha! You fool!
See that? The thorns jutting out of my hands? That's my Stand!
And there you have it! Your flesh bud's been removed, bud! Ba dum tss! Hee hee!
I must defeat DIO!
Well then, it's back to my adventure!
Hurry! Hurry! You're about to make a grown man cry!
I hate to have to tell you, but as it stands now, you're about to be hospitalized.
I may have had to run at times, but I've never abandoned a fight!
I could really go for a bite to eat...
The difference between us is all too clear... You're not even fit to shine my shoes!
Phew! That's the last thing my old ticker needed!
Allow me to help you... on your way to hell!
I'm sure of it! As sure as I am that I'll burp if I drink some cola!
Hey, relax! I'm just kidding!
We'll meet again! Unless you've had enough of me...you blasted fool!
N—No! It can't be! DIO's "The World" can really stop time?!
Let's go!
WRYYYYYYYYYY!
You! You saw me!
Well done.
I'm satisfied enough. Now there's no need to play with you toys anymore!
Foolish human! I will rule over you! Bow before my might and intelligence!
That's all?
I think I like you.
Heh heh heh heh. I'll give you one chance.
What's wrong? You're trembling.
You'll just have to die.
Relax. No need to be scared sick.
Fair warning: I will suck you dry!
A trickster, are you?
Heh... I'll give you some credit.
Too slow!
Let me test you out a little more...
Time to end this, now.
I'm asking you! Can you see it or not?!
Can you see it or not?
MUDAMUDA!
Oh, what rapture! Soon I'll be able to stop time for one, ten, even 60 minutes...
I, DIO, have far surpassed all the Stand users and creatures who inhabit our world! And now I can stop time for a whole 5 seconds!
Hmph! You're mine! If we were playing chess or shogi right now, you'd be in CHECKMATE!
Invincible...immortal...STAND POWER!!
I, DIO, possess none of that! All I have is one simple principle... Just one! Win, and seize control! That's it! That alone is my satisfaction!
I must eliminate Jonathan's bloodline forever...
I offer you a proposal: why not become my partner?
Just to make this clear, I'm not afraid of the Joestars, I just know that their bloodline is not to be underestimated!
My left side is weak... This body still isn't fully used to me.
Got to match the right blood with the right body... Look, it's mixing in perfectly!
Go down two steps. I'll let you join me again. But if you want to die... step upward.
You could serve me forever, hm? I can offer you an eternal security.
This is The World. Not that you can see or feel it. Time has stopped for you.
Seeing as how this is Jonathan's body, wouldn't you agree that Joestar blood would be the perfect match for it?
You're finished...
Automobiles are convenient until everyone has one, jamming the roads. But when time stops, only one can move... DIO, and DIO alone!
To be honest, I'm glad I was able to kill you quickly, Jotaro.
No one can assassinate DIO...
Now to squeeze out the last drops! Heh heh heh heh!
I still feel the power...
Oh, this feels goo-oo-ood!
You want to live out your life the right way? You want to live an honest life without any regrets? The way you think is as stupid as rat shit smeared all over a toilet, and now it's going to be the death of you!
The process... The method... You think I care about that!?
Back me up!
I couldn't help but laugh, heh heh!
It's my lucky day!
Dying before getting to say goodbye is the lay of the land, amigo.
C'mon!
That's a real bad joke!
Don't do anything stupid!
Cocky little punk!
I'm gonna beat you silly!
Don't get cocky!
Lucky!
Let's do it!
Hold your horses!
Just try and escape!
Give it up...
It's the end of the line!
I can do this!
I'm gonna blow your brains out, DIO!
Stop being a wimp!
Stop screwin' with me!
What the hell?!
No one beats us! We're the unbeatable duo!
We're the unbeatable duo!
This...this is totally nuts!
This is totally nuts!
Oh, it's on now!
Let's throw down!
Now I'm super pissed! Adios, amigo. Die!
Now I'm super pissed!
Adios, amigo. Die!
I'll split your skull!
Hol Horse... That's my name.
Even my bullets are part of my Stand! You didn't realize that, and it cost you bad!
I guess death is pretty anticlimactic most of the time, huh?
I hope we can meet again. If you all manage to survive, that is.
The treasure's mine, too!
Bye bye. Hol Horse loves ya!
I...I can't beat this guy! I can't do a thing all by myself! Better run for now!
I'm running because I love you, baby. Forever!
I stick by the strongest guy I find. That's it! I won't sell my soul for nothin'!
I'm going all-out here...!
I'm on your side... Don't worry. Relax, okay? Relax.
I may lie to women, but I never hit them! Beauties and beasts, I respect all of them!
This makes me wanna cry! I knew I shoulda just sniped you out!
Time to attack!
Tch! That was a close one. Heh heh.
I knew it... This one will be trouble.
Thank you for allowing me to finish you off...
Trying to silence yourself now? It's far too late for that...
Hm? These footsteps...
I know both your position and your height!
...Heh heh heh.
This overwhelming power! No!
Seems like you've realized that N'doul here tracks things by sound... Heh heh heh... Not like it will change anything, though... Heh heh heh!
I almost had it. Guess I didn't practice enough... Heh heh.
Let me just tell you one thing. My name is N'doul. My Stand represents the origin of the Tarot cards... Geb, one of the 9 Egyptian Glory Gods!
I need to listen more closely...
Now I no longer have any need to trace sound with this staff...
I can hear the reverberations...
If I hadn't brought my water Stand back and used it to guard me, you would have already got me from behind, huh?
Heh Heh... So you've caught the great N'doul, have you? Unfortunately, you were just a tad too late.
Help me!
My power is far greater than yours!
Enough already, idiot!
The magnetic force will just keep on increasing!
No, no! Unfortunately, you have to die.
You think you're clever, do you? You little turds!
I'll burn you to a crisp!
Whew!
You're mine...
You always want to touch the things you're told not to.
O-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh! I've won, Lord DIO...
By the way, you looked pretty handsome out there.
You're nothing compared to Lord DIO's charisma.
Going numb? Heh heh heh.
Once you fall prey to Bast's magnetism, there's no escape...
Ho ho ho ho...
Hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!
Caaaaaw!
(lick)
(GRIN)
Gyooh!
Squawk!
Guhgggh...
Ngggh...
Caaaaw
Caw!
Caaaaaw!
Caw caw, caw caw!
Gggheeeh!
Caaaw!
Ggggh...
This bird's name is Animal Shop. His Stand represents the god of the sky, Horus.
Gyaaah!
Gughehhh...
Gyooooon!
Gggh...
Ggheee...
Snap, snap, snap, snap!
Squawk, squawk! (GRIN)
Now!
You're powerless before me...
I swear I'll kill you!
It's time to settle this once and for all!
I have no time to waste on pain.
I'll kill the whole lot of you!
Sorry to disturb your slumber...
This is a gift!
This much is certain: I will find you... and I will kill you.
Trying to slip away and hide in the confusion, hmm?
It's no use... You won't get far on those legs.
Oh where oh where could you be...?
I'm going to blow you away!
How dare you do this to me!
I'll stomp the life out of you!
DIO... I trust that I have not let you down.
One by one, my void will destroy each and every one of you.
My Stand is vastly superior in every way imaginable.
Please, leave this to me.
You brought this on yourself! It's all your fault!
I'll defeat them all for you... I swear it!
I blew him away. And you're next...
They were crushed into tiny pieces...and died.
It's just as Lord DIO said... Nobody can hurt me.
Start with the legs! Prevents both sudden movements and escape!
You're not worthy to face Lord DIO!
The real Lord DIO would never come down from his room for a trifle such as this!
Lord DIO told me that he believes in me, that he trusts me!
I could have you sucked into my void in an instant, but it's better than you deserve!
You! You're the one who enraged me so!
This blood isn't on your hands...
I may have been wounded, but it takes more than a few scratches to kill me...
Yes... Gladly, Lord DIO.
Here we go!
Out of my way or I wreck your face!
No problems on my end!
Well this just great.
My Shining Diamond is gonna beat your ass—till it shines!
I'm going to beat your ass till it shines...
I'm ready to take you on!
Are you crazy?
Gotta do what you gotta do...
You got guts, I'll say that much.
What do you think you're doing?!
Well, thanks a lot!
Stupid idiot!
Don't get cocky!
I don't know what the hell any of this is about!
Your chances of winning waved "bye bye" to you a while ago.
Damn it! You bastard!
This shock will be enough to blow your Stand to the moon!
Quit moving around like that!
Way to fall for it!
You think I'm a bad guy?
I'm gonna wipe that "peaceful" look right off your face.
I'm gonna knock all the "peace" right off your face!
Your moves are so slow!
You don't want this bad enough!
Stop it right there! Not another damn word from you!
In just a few minutes, this will all be over.
We throwing down, or not?!
Make fun of my hair, and I get pissed off. I don't know why! I guess it's just instinct.
Good thing you're such an idiot or I might have lost!
Call me Josuke Higashikata, the man who turns the tables back on his foes!
Duh, I wasn't scared of you, stupid-head! Ah crap, I sound like a little kid!
This feels awesome. Like a new pair of undies on the first day of the year!
Repent for eternity!
Fuse with the stone and live right here, in this town, forever.
I guess there wasn't enough anger for you in my heart.
Guess I wasn't mad enough before.
We don't need stinking garbage like you in our town!
I dunno why, really. I just suddenly thought to myself, "This isn't worth dyin' for."
That was a pretty great close call. But don't forget: Shining Diamond can heal, too! Better write that down so you don't forget again!
Hunting for nice-looking girls? That's not for me. I believe in true love.
My pride would never allow me to lose to you!
OH YEAH! Whoops, sorry to scare you. That's just my pump-up scream! OH YEAH!
So I'm a hard pill to swallow, huh? Tell me something I don't know!
You can do this, Josuke! You can make this turn! You have to!!
I can't really put a finger on it, but something about you is kinda cool!
You have the perfect strategy! Except for the parts that won't work. Like all of it.
Now, time to go to OWSON and buy the latest Ultra Jump!
Please!
Look at what happened to me! I'm telling you, I hate your guts!
I hate your guts!
Now I'm getting even more pissed off...
Bring me 500,000 yen by tomorrow or else!
Look at what happened to me!
I'm telling you, I hate your guts!
I'm getting angry! Why do I have to be all scared and regretful all the time?!
I'm getting angry!
Why do I have to run around scared and praying for my life all the time?!
Why do I have to run around all the time?!
I told you... Don't mistake me for a small fry.
I can't hold back anymore!
This isn't a joke!
Don't you see how much I don't like you?!
You can't beat my Reverb with tricks like that!
You can't beat my Reverb!
I'm not playing around!
I'm really gonna attack!
Why should I have to feel like, "I'd be so much happier if I were on the brink of diarrhea, desperate for a public toilet!" just to make it out of this alive?!
You're gonna be the one running around scared soon!
Don't screw with me!
You...
You coward!
Run if you want...
Still at it, huh?
Let's do it!
"Amidst the chirring of cicadas, quietness seeps into the rocks." That's from one of Basho's poems!
I...I'm so happy!
I gotta hand it to you. You've come far.
My Act 3 is awesome!
You're nothing but talk...
Heh heh... Just kidding! Really! It's just a joke!
If my town is in danger, then my parents, sister, and all my friends are, too!
If someone saw this, we'd be in big trouble.
I'm not stopping the sound... Not until I hear you cry and apologize!
Say what you will... I'll never understand it.
Woo-hoooooo!
A-All right... This was a shock to me, but I have to do something!
I was so scared! But I'm relieved now!
I really regret this... Jotaro was honestly a teacher to me! I should have known he'd be a rough one...
Wait... If I look hard, like Jotaro said... I can see your weakness now!
But that's it! Your weakness! It's right there!
He's lost sight of me now...
I HAVE PROTECTED YOU AS ORDERED. MY WORK IS COMPLETE.
3... FREEZE! "THREE" AND "FREE" SOUND VERY SIMILAR. NOT THAT IT MATTERS.
IF YOU MOVE OVER 5M AWAY FROM THEM, THEIR WEIGHT WILL DISAPPEAR, THEY'LL STOP PANTING, AND THEY'LL COME RUSHING TOWARD YOU LIKE A HYPERACTIVE DOG IN HEAT!!
I COULD MAKE HIM EVEN HEAVIER. WHAT IS YOUR COMMAND?
You're a complete idiot! I look forward to seeing you in the afterlife!
I'm claustrophobic, so I can understand how scary it is not to be able to breathe.
W-well yeah, I was scared! But something horrible is happening in my town. And if my town is in danger, that means my parents, sister, and all my friends are, too! I need to get to the bottom of this...
I'm a little thirsty... Guess I'll go to OWSON.
Let's go!
It's time to settle the score!
Look at how loosened up my shoulder joints are now!
My shoulder joints feel more flexible now!
I feel great! Like I just woke up from 10 hours of sleep!
I feel like a million bucks!!
I can't wait to get my Hand on you and wipe you out, ya dumbass!
I just wanna swipe you out of this world so badly, I can hardly take it!
Ahhhh ha ha ha ha ha!
If you think you're man enough to try it, then try it, punk!
Try it, punk!
Quit standing so far from me, you wuss!
Shut up, would ya?
Hurry up already! I hate it when people take too long!
Stupid idiot!
You're the bad guy here.
Ugigigi?
Think you can escape my next attack?
You got a death wish, pal?!
I'm tired of all this thinking!
I'm not that smart, okay?!
You ready to die?!
Don't make fun of me!
I'll smash you to pieces!
It's too late...
Hmmm? Hohh!
Dumbass!
Ka ha ha ha!
You pig!
No way! Okuyasu Nijimura's Hand's gonna slap you good!
I'm not that smart, okay?! I just do what my heart tells me to do!
Niiiiice!
I'll take anything you got! Unless it's the clap.
I've always wondered: Where does the stuff The Hand wipes out go to, huh?
I'm shavin' away space! Look, I'm comin' closer! See that? TELEPORTATION! BOOYAH!
Let's move! Go, go, go!
Ah! I love it! This is enough to make me drool! I just gotta have it!
What a happy scene.
Niiiiice! Ahhhhh...
This water tastes so elegant. Like an alpine princess playing the harp! It's just so pure... It feels like I'm drinking water for the first time after wandering around a desert for three days straight!
Harmony, right? "Perfect blend," right?
It's really addictive... Like, one taste, and it just drags you in.
It's like, you only mean to eat a couple chips, but then you eat the whole bag, y'know?
When you commit a crime, then sooner or later you'll pay for it. Even I know that!
So I can surpass my older brother, huh? Thanks for the lesson.
I've always relied on my brother in my life... I'm not good at making decisions on my own!
Woo-hoo! What a fairy tale! What a fantasy!
Well, well, well. You happy now?
You just bumped yourself to the top spot on the Okuyasu/Josuke combo hit list!!
I'm going home... I feel weird. Like, something's really bugging me...
You keep running your mouth like that and I'm gonna cork it up!
Of course, I'm pretty dumb, so I get a headache whenever I think real hard!
I saw a weird dream... I was walking in the darkness, then I saw a light and met my dead brother, Keicho...
Oh yeah!
And then my brother said I had to decide for myself...
So then I said, "I'm goin' to Morioh Town," and then I woke up. Boy, that was a sad dream.
We're like two pop stars singing a duet! The perfect combination! Like peas and carrots! Get what I mean...?
I'm hungry... Let's stop by OWSON.
Let's go!
Did you think the great Rohan Kishibe draws manga just for money or praise!?
I want to draw so much! I must keep drawing!
Shut up! Just try me!
I need to draw something really badly!
I must keep drawing!
It looks positively horrendous! How can you stand to walk around with that in this day and age!?
I mean, it'd be fun if I could take 30,000 yen from you.
I don't draw manga for praise!
Let's see how this tastes.
Ah! What a perfect pained expression!
Let me make a sketch.
Stop with all the lies!
I'll turn you into a book! A book depicting your life itself!
I'll turn you into a book!
This experience... it's amazing!
I can't put him in my manga. No reader would ever sympathize with such a fool.
No reader would ever sympathize with such a fool.
I'm afraid I can't use you.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
I can't wait to taste your reality!
You'd make excellent material for me!
If I were the hero of a manga story, what would I do here?
If I was the main character of a manga...
Ka ha ha ha!
Don't screw with me!
You dare insult ME, cretin?!
You dare insult me...
Cretin!!
Reality is the energy that drives a story. It is the purest form of entertainment!
People think manga is all made up. But no! It's only good if it's based on real experience!
Rohan Kishibe isn't gonna listen to some amateur!
Listen up! The hardest thing of all is surpassing oneself!
Like hell I will! I love saying "NO" to people who think they're so tough!
How does a spider feel before it dies? I need to know, so I can keep creating realities!
My ability, "Heaven's Door," can open the door to your heart.
Don't worry. It won't kill you.
Reading your memories gives me new, fresh ideas to put into my work! How exhilarating!
It's so fun looking into other people's lives, no matter how average they seem.
I've got the best material a manga artist could ever dream of!
I draw manga so that people will read it. That's all. Just one simple reason, and I couldn't care less about anything else!
You'd never know what it feels like to get a world-class idea for a story!
I'm drawing a masterpiece right now!
Show me the next page! With each one I tear off, you lose weight...but you don't mind, do you? After all, you'll get to live forever as one of my masterpieces!
I'm on the rise! As a manga artist, and as a Stand user!
What a great story! What an amazing experience! I'm so very pleased!
What a rare experience this is! I must integrate it with my work somehow!
Winning means being able to look down at your opponent like this!
Nice! I like you! I have a soft spot in my heart for people with real guts, as if they just jumped out of an action manga!
Fast fact: If yakuza catch you cheating on dice, they gouge your eyes with two of them.
Where's the third one? Well, they stab you 21 times before disposing of your body.
Add up the 6 sides of a die, and you get 21. That's where the last die went.
Beating other people isn't that hard to do... The hardest thing of all is surpassing oneself!
Here I come!
My left eyelid is throbbing now.
Would you please stop teasing Koichi?
You have the same kind of ability as me, don't you?!
Your friends don't like you very much, do they?
Koichi belongs to ME!
Allow me to educate you!
Excuse me. I'm in a hurry.
You'll regret this...
Look at me...
Now you've really done it! You dumbass!
You're just so stupid. What a disappointment.
Why does it only last for 30 minutes?!
It's true that you managed to scare me a little, but now that I've seen what you can do, I have nothing to fear!
I'm quite fond of Koichi.
Haaaa!
All I want is a heart-to-heart connection. That's the whole reason I get up in the morning...
I'm gonna getcha!
I can spot lies a mile away!
This makes no sense! This makes no sense! This makes no sense!
A-Ahem!
I can sell it to ya for a cool 10,000 yen! Shee shee shee!
I'll sell it to you for 10,000 yen!
You keep chasing me and I'll kill you!
I hate bad things!
Who's da man? I'm da man!
You want proof? Hm?
I'll show you!
You're no match for me!
My Harvest is amazing!
Enough of your excuses!
I'll show YOU who's lame!
That's some big talk from a LOSER!
My Harvest will "Harvest" your FACE!
I knew it!
Quit it!
What the hell!?
Ugh! That's disgusting!!
Now I'm ticked!
I'm not a dweeb!
Harvest! Take it away!
I don't like your face!
You make me puke!
A-are you gonna be okay?
Never have to worry about money with the Harvest on my side!
How about that! I'm pretty awesome, right?
We're allies, right? You've got the same abilities.
Whoa! You're for real!
So you were talking about me behind my back before?
One time, I wanted to see if the 41 yen, 62 yen, and 150 stamps tasted different if you licked 'em, so I did! Then mom got mad at me... I just wanted to taste 'em!
Oh, score! A piece of only slightly prechewed gum! <icon heart>
I picked up about 120,000 yen before, but this, this is even better!
Fine then, I'll give it to you the hard way! I'll give it all to you! We're friends, after all!
Hey sister! I'm rolling in cash! How 'bout a date?
Now everyone will know we're friends! Shee shee shee!
I see! So that's what you said!
I did it!
Who's laughing now, chump!
Hey now! I really appreciate your obedience!
Ah, I getcha! Now it makes sense!
I was blinded by my own greed. But now I see again!
M-Money, you say?!
M-My sandwich! W-Where did it go?!
I'll protect you, mom and dad!
I will protect Papa and Mama from him!
Scum like you has no place anywhere!
Let's jam!
I'll beat you with my pinky!
I'm here to kill you in style, baby!
Heh heh heh heh!
I'm gonna put all the electricity I've used on your meter. Hee hee!
Sucker! I was only pretending to freak out!
You can't hold a candle to me!
You're SO going down!
You see? This kind of crap is nothing to me!
The entire town's electrical system is my rock 'n roll ally!
You're way too immature to be my groupie!
Bye-bye!
What's that, your last will and testament?
Time to send you to Valhalla!
Cut the crap!
The rules don't apply to trash like you!
You're dead!
Get real!
You lose again!
Too easy.
I rock harder than ever!
I'm not trying to talk down to you. You're so predictable that you make it so easy!
I'll kill your mom, too!
Behold what's in my heart! The ultimate rage! I played my soul out! Now, I demand thunderous applause from the foolish masses!
You know you love me. <icon heart>
I'll take the Bow and Arrow for my own, and do what I please with it!
Didn't realize how much Red Hot Chili Pepper has grown, did you?
I've been stopping by your place for a while now!
It's been a while, so I just wanted to see how much my Stand's improved.
C'mon! Hit me with your best shot!
Guess I got a little bit too cocky with this guy.
What a surprise... I'm not the only one that's coming up in the world, I suppose!
Yesssssss.
Akira Otoishi, age 19. Pay no special attention to the guitar!
Behold what's in my heart: the ultimate rage!
Damn it, I gotta rethink my stupid ideas!
You see that? The entire town's electric grid is on my side!
Alright, too easy! I still have a chance, now!
Victory is mine!
Ready?
You need to be... disposed of!
You should have stayed in bed.
Everything my Deadly Queen touches turns into a bomb.
Everything I touch turns into a bomb.
You impertinent brat!
You vex me!
I've got to deliver these documents... Farewell.
I've got to deliver these documents.
What's this... Have I been found out?
Was I seen...?
You have the same kind of ability as me, don't you!?
I leave no witness alive...
Both of your parents... I'm going to kill them too.
How do I keep getting myself into these situations?
Awww. Need a tissue?
Hey hey...
You're an interesting one, aren't you?
Your "power" is powerless!
Have I ever neglected you? Hm?
The stench is getting noticeable... I daresay it's time I "cut" ties with this girl. Heh heh heh... Guess I'll have to go and find another girl on a trip or something...
Are there others besides you who know who I am? Talk, damn you!
I'm going to blow you to smithereens! Then peaceful rest will be mine at last!
Ah, now I can breathe easy.
I've got to do something to get myself out of this hole!
I can't place it, but somehow I feel divine luck is always on Yoshikage Kira's side.
I've told you before: all I want is to live peacefully.
I'd tell you about my "Deadly Queen..." but it seems you're already quite acquainted!
Behold the power of my Deadly Queen. It leaves not a trace of evidence behind.
I'll detonate anyone who dares follow my trail...
My Deadly Queen's Heart Attack never fails to eliminate its targets...
How dare you disgrace me in front of complete strangers!
There's nothing I hate more than standing out in a crowd!
What a disaster...
A gym is opening near Budougaoka High... Maybe I should join? I need to build up some stamina...
I've got to hand it to you. I even feel slightly defeated... You must be something special!
This is the first time I've been pushed so far...
I have to kill you now... If I don't, I won't be able to look myself in the mirror.
In 60 seconds, I'll blow you away with my Deadly Queen. Until then, take after me and learn to bear your pain!
He's wearing his socks inside out... Has he no shame?!
What a day... Hands down the worst of my entire life...
I've always been able to get out of binds... I'll get away fine. You'll see.
It seems that I won't be able to sleep in peace. But only for tonight!
Leave it to me.
Destiny has allied itself with Yoshikage Kira!
I used to measure distance like this back in summer camp, too. Oh what a dreadful place!
We all need to get along...and be kind to one another...
We all gotta get along!
I'll blow you away!
No. You'll die.
It's useless...
My Deadly Queen won't have trouble blocking you now.
I won't have trouble blocking you now...
You'll never tell anyone!
Those eyes... Desperate, like a mouse drowning in the septic tank.
Desperate, like a mouse drowning in the septic tank.
That's right... I'm Yoshikage Kira.
For a first-timer...my accuracy is spot-on.
You can't run anymore!
I'll wait for you to make your choice.
According to my calculations... Yes. There's no mistaking it.
Oh how wonderful it must be to not have a care in the world.
Ooh, how dangerous...
You little piss-ant!!
People hide their true selves from others. Can you live your whole life like that?
I'm not angry at the world or anything like that. This is just how I unwind.
Why? I'm in no particular rush to hurt you.
Ha ha ha ha! I beat them! Now I can be free!
See how much my nails have grown? Can anyone stop their nails from growing?
I want to show you my true self.
I have a bad feeling about this...
No one... Just like how no one can stop their nails from growing, no one can suppress the disposition I was born with... Nothing can be done about it... What a bother.
Didn't you learn not to answer a question with a question in school?
I don't like killing if it stands out too much...but I have no choice!
No matter where you go or what you try to do, I am now invincible!
Deadly Queen's Bites the Dust is invincible! It hides my true self as if nothing ever happened!
It's not that I was running away from you. If I wanted to kill you, I could anytime.
In Japanese, the word destiny is written as "that which brings life"! Heh heh... That's exactly it.
Overthinking things is a scary idea. Especially if you trust in your skills too much...
I know this is a terrible grievance, but I may be 15 minutes late this morning.
Pfft! Damn you, Kosaku Kawajiri... Is being a big-shot business man really worth all this crap to you?!
When times are worst, that's when your next chance comes. I know that well now.
When I was a kid... I saw Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa."
I saw it in a book... And her hands, laid down on her legs.
The first time I saw it... I, well, you'll have to excuse my language, but... Heh heh... I happened to...get an erection...
I cut off the part with the hands and put it up in my room. I want to cut off your hands, too.
No! I'm at my limit! I'm gonna push it!
Please assist me!
I'm prepared to cut open a new road for myself!
You look like someone who came prepared.
There's one thing I will never allow at any cost: your escape.
I can't let you escape.
Don't resist and I promise that knocking you out is the worst I'll do.
Don't resist, and I promise you I won't do anything.
I will create life itself!
Life... spring forth!
Life, spring forth!
Life, spring forth...!
Yeah, well, you took a punch as powerful as the ones you throw yourself. Deal with it!
Only one road left for you to follow!
You are an insult to life itself.
I'm going to slam Golden Wind right into your head. Let's see you move after that!
I'm going to slam Golden Wind right into your head.
I'm telling you, it's impossible! Stop struggling!
I'm telling you, it's impossible!
Stop struggling!
Something... bizarre is going on!
This isn't normal! What's going on here... What's this atmosphere I feel?!
Something terrible is happening here!
Something terrible...
I was doomed to butt heads with you from the start!
I was doomed to butt heads with you!
You're just talking to try and buy time.
"Know yourself...?" You think someone like you ever really can?
You really think it's that easy?
Hate to sound cold... but you'd better stay away from me.
Were your actions born from truth...or merely superficial evil? Time to find out.
Being prepared isn't about sacrifice! True preparation means cutting open a bright path along the darkest of fields!
Even your defeat brings me no joy. My victory was assured from the start.
That which is inherited must move toward what lies beyond!
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDAAA!
There's no longer any road ahead for you... And you'll never reach truth! Never!
Once should've been enough. But I have to tell you twice? Do you have half a brain?!
Holding back on me despite all the damage you took... you must be a good person, I can tell.
You went easy on me... You're a good person.
Oh no... And I just declared that I'd keep civilians out of this, too. Sorry. That was a lie.
You aren't going to kill me any longer. Why? Because we're going to be friends.
I'm going to be a Gang Star!
What is this feeling? It's like something new is springing forth from my Golden Wind!
Humans learn more from failure than they do from successes or victory...
Once you were able to do as you wanted, you saw how pointless it was...
Your preparation lights the path ahead...more brightly than the rising sun.
A ladybug is a messenger from the heavens. It brings you good luck.
How easy it was to beat that guy! It's like he came for a beating!
Margherita pizza? I could go for a good pizza... A nice simple Margherita, like they made in my hometown, Neapolis.
You can't fool me! You're only pretending to be dead!
Golden Wind is my Stand. It can put an end to anything within 2 meters!
I'm going to leave you here for now... So that no one will ever hurt you again... But I promise I'll take you back to your homeland eventually.
There's no road ahead for you.
Thanks to you, my Golden Wind has grown stronger!
Let's go!
Try me!
I can see that you're truly prepared for this!
Answer me. This interrogation has now become a torture!
Answer me. This interrogation has now become a torture!
How about it? My skills make you shiver, no?
You can't do anything now.
No matter what, I can always put this into your mouth...
I can always put this into your mouth...
This one's special. When he says he's going to do something, it's as good as done.
This one's special. When he says he's going to do something, it's as good as done.
What's wrong? Come at me.
I'll show you. I'm far more prepared than you are!
I'm far more prepared than you are!
Quit while you're ahead!
Oh how low you've fallen. You're less than scum!
"Carry out the mission and protect our men." Think you can handle that?
"Carry out the mission and protect our men."
I'm rubbing you out... Now!
Hiding yourself? I don't know what you are, but you can't be that powerful.
You can't be that powerful.
This is rougher than I had thought!
Enough talk from you!
Stop talking. You're not making any sense.
You need power before anything else!
It was a hard path to take... one that I'd never reach without a dose of luck.
In the world of a gangster, don't assume anyone is dead until the deed is done!
My job is to protect my men and complete the mission. Hard to do both!
No matter how twisted this world may be, I will walk the path I believe in!
I felt a noble resolve in your eyes, like diamond. But you've fallen. You're scum.
Disgraces like you screw up everything they do!
Using the ignorant simply for his own benefit...it's vomit-inducing evil!!
I'll never forgive you! You betrayed me again!
I couldn't forgive you. I couldn't ignore what happened. That's why I betrayed you!
You'd never be able to understand my soul!
Good to meet you here... If you aren't busy, I've got a question for you.
I want to steal an airplane. Wonder where I can find one...
I took this as fate. A tiny stroke of fate that heaven allowed...
Us making it this far means total victory. This is good. All of it is...
Fate is a sleeping slave... We managed to release it, and now we've won.
All I could do was die a slow death... but then my soul was reborn!
Don't worry... everything's just going back to the way it should be. That's all.
Let's go!
Uno! Due! And you're dead! Let's see you "prepare" for that!
Don't you get it, you idiot?
Uno! Due! Now die!
You came prepared for this, right?
Human meat... You think it'd taste good if you ate some?
Human meat... You think it would taste good?
Hahhhh hah hahhhhh... Ukekekekekeke!
Hahhhh hah hahhhhh...
Ukekekekekeke!
Stop screwing with me!
Hey, what're you doing?!
I want to eat some strawberry cake!
You're a riot, you know that?
Allow me to persuade you.
Something bothering you?
Oops. No good, huh?
I don't know who you are, but so be it!
I want to settle this here. I'm gonna shoot one straight in your mouth!
Come on, let's finish this.
I'm gonna shoot you right in the mouth!
I swear I'll cut you down... with one shot!
I swear I'll cut you down...
With one shot!
Now's my chance to kill you!
I'm taking you down!
Sorry to say this, but I'd shoot even the pope if he came near this plane!
I'd shoot even the pope if I had to!
Okay! That's perfect... Just the right position!
No escape!
Okay, everyone! It's lunch time! Salame Toscano is delicious!
C'mon, guns aren't as loud as they are in the movies. But if it really bugs you... I'm busy right now, so quit your bitching!
All right, Bullets! Time to get back to ammunition form!
If we're going in order of talent, that makes me next in line to be in charge!
That proves it! You could never beat me! You're in a completely lower class!
I like selecting from out of 5 choices! Not 4! 3 works, too! But bad things happen with 4.
You don't want to drink because you don't want to be friends, huh?
Which do you want me to use? The glasses, or the fishing line?
They don't work until they get to eat lunch. I'm different, of course. But these guys have gotten used to doing things this way...
Come on! Quit fighting! Just get along and start chowing down!
I always take care never to play favorites!
Aww yeah, Bullets! You guys are the best!
4 shots... What the hell? I only have 4 left! Why 4?! Come on!!
Yeah? Heh heh heh. You interested in her "assets," too? Well, so am I!
Why don't you kiss the road, huh? Use all that momentum you've got and give it a nice, big, wet one!
Ahh! Be gentle, gentle! No, more gentle! Don't take off my clothes! That feels good! Ahh, no, don't!
The force in my soul is surging!
I can't guarantee you won't have another hole between your eyeballs now.
If they haven't made a sculpture of you yet, then you've still got some life left to live...
Let's go!
You! I hope you're prepared to die here!
Ha ha ha! Your very name dooms you to an eternity in HELL!
Your very name dooms you to an eternity in HELL!
Yeah! That's right!
Sneaky bastard!
Let me tell you something!
I'll kill ya! I'll straight up kill ya!
This feels weird...
Now you've done it!
It's all right, it's all right...
What the hell are you going on about?! Wait up, damn it!
What the hell are you going on about?! Wait up!
You! You even trying?!
I'm gonna rip you apart!
Yes! Right on time!
Damn it! He got away!
Now I won't have to set the whole town on fire to find you!
Your shopping list... I can't finish it. All the money and the stuff got burned.
We're gonna get out of here safe. All of us. Got that?
I'm going to school once I get back home. I'm sick of people saying I'm stupid!
Hmph! Quit struggling!
It's nice outside. Why should I sit and study all day? I'm really not into this...
Hey, mind if I touch you? Or smell you, at least?
Once I'm done shopping, I'm gonna go around to some vineyards...
So I just gotta keep from being tailed as I get back, right?
A stapler! Ha ha ha! It's bound like a comic book now!
Can you look the other way? I'll be done in five more minutes!
I want to bathe in the sun while reminiscing about my childhood years!
The pain you feel means you're healing... But don't look forward to your future yet!
Ah! I got junk in my eye! I can't see! I can't tell if you're two people or not! Nope, I can't see a thing at all!
Oh man, I just remembered how hungry I am!
Alright, let's go back to everyone else.
Not even the rabbits in the fields are coming near me.
You're definitely dead. I had to shoot you in the head, so I doubt anyone can ID you.
Still no one takes me seriously!
I'm in real bad shape. Let me rest a bit.
I want a piping hot pizza! A real Margherita from my hometown, cooked on oak wood, loaded with porcini mushrooms!
Here I go!
You have my utmost respect!
I don't understand!
Jeez...
Hell no!
If you insist...
What's going on...?
You brainless pile of crap!
Pfft!
Don't play dumb with me!
Huh?
Enough already!
This is getting crazy!
Moron!
What the hell?!
You've lost touch with reality... Nobody gets through life on dreams alone!
You've lost touch with reality...
Nobody gets through life on dreams alone!
N-No way!
Why you...
Come here!
You idiot!
What have you been up to all this time?
I don't understand a damn thing you're talking about.
Why...? Are you out of your mind?!
That's just superstition!
Purple Smoke's virus is now spreading out through your entire body! Once it infects someone, not even I can stop it!
I...I did it!
Where do you think you can run to?!
The hell were you thinking?!
Do as you were taught. If anyone can do it, you can.
You're really something.
I knew you could do it!
You messing with me, punk?!
What happened!? Where did you hide it!?
I am Fugo.
Don't screw with me!
I get what you're saying... And you're right.
What's wrong with you guys!? You're going to be completely cut off now!
This has nothing to do with us! We could just feign ignorance!
How could you get swept up in your emotions!?
I defeated him, and his ability disappeared!
Help me!
I need to know the truth about my parents!
Kyaaaah!
Can I...go the bathroom?
I'm missing my handkerchief, so go buy me one.
Oh, and get me the latest issue of Italian Vogue while you're at it.
I can't hurry! If I hurry, I'll die!
Good! Seems like you finally understand now!
Why can I suddenly see all these bizarre things? What's going on?!
Arrivederci! (Farewell)
WAAAAAAAANNABEEEEEEEEEE
This is your ability!
I did it! I won! Finally!
Well... That's certainly got some flavor to it...
I already figured that out...a while back...
I can't forgive you... Even my heart is telling me not to...
I'm going to...overcome this...
Assist me!
It's the result that counts! The result is the only thing that lives in infamy!
I'm not even going to give you enough time to regret the fact that you're dead!
You're making me break out in a cold sweat...
Now you've pissed me off!
Think it over again! Who is the one king worthy of holding the arrow?!
Just go home, now...
Unbelievable moves!
The result is the only thing that lives in infamy!
You can't reach the first floor... but I can easily take you to hell.
You won't get away from me!
Don't worry. I'll make this painless for you.
I don't know what the hell's going on, but eat this!
I can predict your moves!
Look at me! Tell me who you think is the worthy one!
With the future laid out before me, all I need to do is find the pitfall that pops up! As long as I avoid it, my life will never sink—I'll be able to remain on top forever!
Why must I attract nothing but idiots?! Is everyone in this world an idiot?!
BRING RING RING RING RING
I, Diavolo, am emperor! Just as I always was!
I can push ahead all time aside from my own!
Your ego's led you to believe that you can overcome me. Is that it?
No one who senses my true nature can be be allowed to survive!
You can try and erase it, but the past always has true human peace in a choke hold.
Those who know my true nature cannot be left alive.
Damn it. I have to admit that was kind of impressive!
Ciao. Yes, Doppio speaking.
True fear comes from the past you never knew.
If only you knew just how well you've served me!!
"We are all soldiers of fate", but not I. Fate has put my Emperor Crimson at the apex! I am no soldier!
Looks like I won't be swallowing my pride this time.
How many times am I going to die? Where... What's going to come and attack me next!? I, I... Stay away from me!!
Say goodbye!
Give me a damn break!
I'm the one who gives out orders here.
If you wanna go, I'll take you on!
I am Jolyne Cujoh!
If you're going to bring it... then bring it now!
Now I'll never get married!
I'm so hungry right meow!
You look like a fruit!
I really don't like you!
I'm gonna retire you.
I'll knock you unconscious.
You've got some nerve...
All I need is a few millimeters!
A few millimeters will decide the battle.
If I can just get a few millimeters into range, I can hit home with my fist.
Shhh, shhhh...
I'm gonna keep going... until I strike you down!
Just try it! Try and attack!
I need to keep storming ahead!
Lucky!<icon heart> Woo-hoo!
This isn't over yet.
If I said I'm innocent... Would you believe me?
Ewwww! What is this?! Gross! So weird!
Got wax in your ears? The name is Stone Ocean. Remember it.
Gimme a friggin' break, already!
I'm gonna get even stronger!
The power of nature is a lot more effective than the power of my string.
Use your heart's force to move and defend. That's all.
How about it? Wanna join forces with me? It's your call, but don't kill anyone!
You're no match at all for my Stone Ocean!
Don't need strength to block with string...
I have a goal I need to fulfill! And to do it, I can't waste my power!
Of course I watch the stars. And I'll never stop until I see my father.
That's a wrap!
It finally got through to me. I think... I think I understand my father.
What are handcuffs for? Not to keep you from escaping! To make you submit!
Now I understand... I understand that I don't understand at all.
It's just a coincidence.
That was close. I didn't even have time to think!
There may only be one road ahead, but with the right plan, anything's possible.
I'll stop you here.
Ready to go?
Your foe is right here!
Here! Take my panties! Take them already!
You think about nobody but yourself! Stop pretending you don't!
You think about nobody but yourself!
Damn it! Stop right there!
All you have to do now is scream for me.
Oh my god!
Could someone like you even survive until lunch?
Are you just here to waste my time, or what?!
Has a woman ever given you her panties?
That's right! I said panties! Has a woman ever given you her panties? Wouldn't you be like, "I'm so lucky!<icon heart>" if she did?!
Wouldn't you feel really lucky if you got some panties?!
Putting me through all this crap. Ugh!
Damn it, wait a second!
Hey! Get over here!
You just don't get it.
I'm gonna do this!
Stop jumping around like that!
Give me a scream... A nice, long one.
Give me your best scream!
What's wrong? You're so quiet all of a sudden!
Glad you made it! Time to rip you apart!
You came all the way back here just so I could kill you, huh?!
Nobody likes Mondays, okay? But everyday isn't Monday! Saturday's always coming up!
At the end of the day, you're all you've got!
I...made it in time...
I learned my "skill" in jail. It's a gift from Heaven, and I gotta use it!
Don't you get who I am yet? Think about it.
This sticker? It comes from ME. It's a piece of what I am!
Stickers come out of my hands. It's a fact. And soon, I realized... It's pretty useful.
Gimme my money back, you scum!
It comes out from my palm if I will it... All I have to do is picture it in my mind!
Where are you hiding it, you bastard?! In your pocket?!
I don't care what the reason is.
When I say perfect, I mean it'd make the perfect coffin!
Try to call for help. Only the rats and the roaches are gonna hear you.
You think I want to live out a life where one of my family members has been thrown into the gutter, and I'm forced to forget it? Hell no! I'm prepared to do what it takes to change my life!
Ready? This kick is for Gloria!
And the next one... And the next one too! They're all for Gloria!
I want to cry... but I know I don't have the time to.
Cough it up! 100 dollars!
Assist me!
I'll decide what's important!
I hope you're ready... Ready to regret the day you were born?!
Give it up! It's no use.
I hope you're ready...
Ready to regret the day you were born?!
Get on the ground! Far away from me!
Oh, now you messed up!
Numbskull!
What do you think you're doing?!
Get away from me!
Make sure the gators don't get you on your way back...
So are you gonna bring it or what?
I'll dispose of you!
Your attacks are lacking in punch.
Stop it right there!
If I wanted your opinion, I'd ask for it!
Puny little plankton!
Jolyne better be safe!
What the hell are you talking about!?
I'm tired of your crap! If you're not gonna answer, then pay the price!
Move it! Outta my way!
Don't worry about it!
Come on and fight already!
Who the hell are you?
Heh heh heh... Ha ha!
Give me your blessing! I can't get married without it!
Once I'm sure she's safe, I'm gonna propose to her!
Finished!
I've had such good luck as of late... Right?
She has the purest heart and intentions... They illuminated my dark heart, and saved it from the brink of ruin!
The moment it hits, all I have to do is guard!
Make like a frog and hop along, loser!
We're outta here. Hasta.
I'm your protector! I swear it!
I've had enough of your meddling.
Don't remember? Take a wild guess.
The papers all called me a "murderer." Maybe they're right.
Someone once asked me if I'd risk my life for my own parents, and I said no. I'd probably still say the same thing now. They never had a place on my heart.
I only put my life on the line for the one who saved me...
Ever since we escaped prison, my life is all I've had. If I survive, maybe I'll propose to her. Heh heh heh ha ha... You know, I might just really do it! Ha ha!
If you allow me her hand... I swear I shall not want anything more!
Help me out!
I can control the weather as I please...
Just act like you don't notice...
Stay calm...
Who said you could touch me?! I'm gonna kill you!
Weather? Do I know you, or something? Yes, people call me Weather Forecast... I suppose there are worse names out there.
Wanna go do something fun? Let's let off some steam!
I can no longer suppress my anger... I'm finishing this here!
I've finally caught you...
Now I know what my enemy's face looks like...
What are you talking about?
Get away from me...
I'll kick you to death.
Sorry, but I don't know you people.
Stay away from me!
I'll kick your ass!
I'm dead serious...
What are your plans? I'm going after the priest too...after I break out of here.
North... Just keep heading north.
I can't possibly think of any explanation for this...
Go talk to someone else.
Gah hah hah! Now this is a massage! Do it more on my back! Yeah!!
The only thing I live for is getting my revenge on that scumbag!
Enough!
My Stand's name is Weather Forecast.
I've already finished things...up in the sky over there.
So THAT's why you can't answer me!
Lady Luck's at work again.
No...this is perfect. Well done.
Not a single deviation from the script.
I'm counting on you.
I can control the weather as I please...
Just act like you don't notice...
Stay calm...
Who said you could touch me?! I'm gonna kill you!
Weather? Do I know you, or something? Yes, people call me Weather Forecast... I suppose there are worse names out there.

So THAT's why you can't answer me!
Lady Luck's at work again.
No...this is perfect. Well done.
Not a single deviation from the script.
Attack!
By the name of God, I will smite you!
Stand down... You would hardly even be a trial for me.
All mankind must ascend to Heaven!
Waste your time elsewhere.
Can your brain survive this intense shock?
Don't you see this is worthy of praise?
Do you understand now?
You cannot kill me.
Take me higher!
You know not what you do.
You know nothing!
I will survive, but you're a different story.
It's over for you now.
I have sought to bring all mankind to their destination!
I will make you disappear.
You are a hindrance to me.
Such talk from a sinner.
Time to settle this!
You must prepare yourself for happiness!
This is for the sake of all mankind!
Quit acting like you know all about this!
You will guard me and hoist me up to the stage of Cape Canaveral!
Spiral staircase!
Rhinoceros beetle!
Ruined town!
Fig tart!
Rhinoceros beetle!
Via Dolorosa!
Rhinoceros beetle!
Singularity point!
Giotto!
Angel!
Hydrangea!
Rhinoceros beetle!
Singularity point!
Secret emperor!!
People must live their lives for the sake of reaching Heaven.
Prime numbers can only be divided by themselves and 1. The loneliest numbers...
Glory be to God! We're about to witness the birth of Heaven!
All of you have been attracted to me! You exist to push me upward, to the Age of Heaven!
Your deaths are nothing but sacrifices for the sake of a greater mankind.
People are kind to others only so that they may receive kindness in return. True unconditional live does not exist. What we call unconditional love...is simply an investment people make in the hope that it will take them to Heaven!
Just see that you get it done.
Wonderful... A sure sign that it has finally begun!
Heaven will be mine!
Yes! This great feeling within me! It must be praised!
That instant, the time you spent thinking, will cost you your life!
People are defeated due to the shame in their hearts. People die for their shame.
I shall bring you the total oblivion of death.
All I care about... is obtaining what is born!
Now I can set off for your world, DIO!
Where did you come from? Do you know who you are?
To think that the dwellers of such a fragile straw house would be so insolent as to threaten the fortress and the profound goals that DIO and I have built!
You were the one who pushed me up to Heaven... No one else.
Remember: I do not seek strength. I seek the happiness that all mankind must reach.
Do you believe in gravity? That is why you came here...
Chasing me around is just a waste of time. Victory is mine...
There is a "gravity" to the beginning of all things!
Happiness only comes to those who are truly prepared for it!
Even if you die tomorrow, the preparation you made will keep you happy! It blows all despair away!
What a perfect place to hide a disc...
Attack!
By the name of God, I will smite you!
Stand down... You would hardly even be a trial for me.
All mankind must ascend to Heaven!
Waste your time elsewhere.

What a perfect place to hide a disc...
Please help!
You won't see me back down!
Are you a "just" person?
So you're just another wannabe faker, huh?
What a joke!
I'm ending everything here!
I ain't giving up...
The hell kind of attitude is that?!
You see that? My legs... they can move!
Lesson 4: Pay your respects.
You saw how that went. Your injuries will be fatal. Stand down, now!
Not bad!
Now it's my turn to attack!
Wanna go back home? Now's your last chance.
Whoa! That's the craziest thing I've heard all year!
Make me believe you!
Now! Try and convince me!
If you're in range of my nail bullets, it's all over...
That was a joke! Calm down already!
C'mon, Johnny. Get a grip. You can do this.
In a situation like this, I wish I could say something all tough and cool like Gyro.
I'm so grateful that I got the chance to join this race!
I need an even nobler hunger!
If you're in doubt, don't shoot! But I no longer have any trace of doubt in my mind!
Life, death... Who's good, and who's evil... None of that matters!
Thanks. That's all I can think of to say.
This is the story of my first step. Not literally, but of my step towards manhood.
Are there any rays of hope to be found here?
These aren't nails anymore... They're tusks. I'll call them Tusks!
I used to be so petty, but now I have a goal in life. I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I can't win unless I'm starving for victory.
The winner...was me. Not you.
I can use these fingers to cut cheese... I can even twirl spaghetti with them!
Entering this race revived my heart from the brink of death.
If I give up on the corpse, my heart will die all over again.
I want to believe that he's a good person... I really do. I might be the more evil one here... But I have no solid evidence...
This is a tale of rebirth.
Home... I gotta get back home!
Here goes!
Nyo-ho!
Pizza mozzarella! Pizza mozzarella! Rella rella rella rella...
Can you keep up?
Can't help but feel like you're looking down on me.
That's pretty rude of ya.
Do it. But that's gonna be my signal.
Hey, don't touch it! It's still spinning!
Did you want my opinion?
I'm done trying to talk with you!
Give me a champagne toast, why don't you?!
Better get away before I get dragged in any further...
Get out of here! Now!
This is getting real messed up! I can see so much!
Show me some guts.
Neither of us is getting out of this.
Neither of us can turn back now!
No funny business, now...
I'll etch failure into your very mind!
Keep winning until your opponent is crushed beyond all recognition!
I don't like this guy...
Pay your respects!
I'll beat you down...then beat you down again!
The race is the most important thing here.
I swear to you! I don't know anything either!
Gah hah hah! Nyo-hoh!
Damn it! Wait here, you!
Who hired you?!
You messing with me?!
Headwind has always been there to help your beloved horse keep running!
That was okay! Probably.
Now I'm starting to feel like a winner!
A man's world sure ain't an easy one!
Grazie to my ancestors!
You know what kills the most? Mosquitoes, then horse kicks. You planning to change that?
I joined this race to win! My homeland awaits me!
I need to be convinced. That takes first priority!
So what's the plan? You wanna go again? Huh? Do ya?!
This is the line I walk. One for just me and Valkyrie.
Come into the light.
From now on, you're only allowed to say "I can't do this" four more times.
Spin along the "Path of the Golden Rectangle!" Infinite power is waiting there for you...
Ehhh, what was it again? I forgot. Ha ha ha!
Domenica Sunday!
Grazie to my ancestors!
The long way around was the best shortcut.
"The long way was the best shortcut for me."
When the tennis ball hits the net, nobody can say which side it'll fall on.
Come with me.
Tah dah!
The stronger the foe, the better the trial!
Watch yourself.
The holy corpse has chosen VALENTINE!
I am not acting for my own personal gain.
Get out of here!
You're gonna pay!
Eager to play the hero, are you?
Your stupid little goals matter not to me.
I'm really going to have to hurt you now.
You're up to something...and it's giving me a bad feeling. What exactly are you trying to do?
Soon my nation will be a happy one.
I am about to perform a sacrifice...
I'll rip you into more pieces than the Holy Corpse.
I cannot forgive this!
I'll be back. And when I do, I'll kill you!
This is nothing big.
Stop looking at things from just one viewpoint.
The "orders" I give are part of my battle plan. I am not a murderer.
So far, so good... Soon they will all be mine!
Filthy acts, at a reasonable price.
A whole new level for D4C!
My soul is in clear, unclouded tandem with my actions! Everything I do is for justice!
By obtaining the entire body, I will bring justice the nation!
If someone takes the right napkin first, everyone else must, too. Same thing if someone takes the left one first. The rest have no choice but to follow. That's how society works!
There cannot be two of the same person in any world... Unless you wield my Stand.
The time has come. Let us head to our final destination!
True peace comes not from a handshake between equals, but from the will of an absolute ruler!
All the evils of this world have been blown away to someone else. Kiss them goodbye!
The goddess has been born. Now, the world will no loner be governed by the fools who join hands with each other and daydream about peace and happiness. The strongest country will take the first napkin, and all will begin anew!
So the goddess exists... And she's on my side!
A trial is an offering in disguise. The bigger, the better.
This trial will end with the shedding of your blood.
My mission as president is to preserve peace for my fellow Americans! That's it!
War always occurs at times of great change. The sacrifices of war bear fruit to new advances!
I believe that I have made nothing but good decisions.
I swore to you, and my word is bond. There are no exceptions. I will take no revenge.
I learned about patriotism and filial duty from this handkerchief. It is my touchstone.
Assist me!
I feel so good!
Yeaaah!
The 1st and 2nd Stages were both magnificent races.
"You're all guilty!"
Uh... Oh?
Just keep...looking forward...
(sniff sniff, sniff sniff)
I think it's about time I claimed what's mine.
For some reason I just feel so wonderful!
I'm going to find that man and get my revenge!
Gyaaaaaasssh!
Money...I want money... Simple, right?
Perfect... Just as I planned.
(sniff, sniff)
Fine... I'll trust you.
That neck wound is the wretched thread that leads back to the world I once inhabited!
I'm looking for a Stand user. One who will serve as my loyal subordinate. Allow me to repeat: I want a subordinate.
I beat you.
The World... Time is mine and mine alone!
It's Dio! Dio's here! That's Diego Brando!!
Diego Brando, AKA Dio!
Something's happening...
This trial will be "Subjugation and Certain Death!"
Want some camouflage? Do you like lamps? I mean, you won't light up or anything...
Anyone who gets in my way won't just be drinking stew out of my shoe! I'll tear their pride to pieces and humiliate them! I'll make them crawl on the ground like vermin!
The glory of the Steel Ball Run race is something powerful enough to influence even the British monarchy! I'll do whatever it takes to make it mine!
What point is there in doing that? It's useless! MUDAAA!!
If I run into him... I'll disappear!!
You just hesitated!
I won!
You've just proven all the weaknesses I guessed you had!
The winner is...me!
THE WORLD! I stopped time for five seconds!
It's Diego Brando!! This young nobleman from the British equestrian world is showing some fierce competition, as if to say he's fully capable of dominating this short-distance sprint!
Assist me!
I feel so good!
Yeaaah!
The 1st and 2nd Stages were both magnificent races.

Please help!
Don't mess with me.
Delicious!
Can't you do anything?
Are you there?!
I've made up my mind not to listen to anyone's crap anymore!
What the hell?!
It's a lie... this can't be happening!
I swear I'll make you answer me! Tell me! Who are you?!
Something's wrong with you!
I'll smash you! Up-close and personal!
Don't try anything funny!
Enough with your stupid tricks!
Don't try any funny business with me!
You say something? I can't hear you!
Don't screw with me!
What did you do?!
What the hell are you?
You idiot.
Yasuho...Hirose...
Who am I?
What am I doing here?
Where did I come from? I can't even remember that.
In that case, how should I weigh my body down?
I don't get it... I'm clueless.
You're the only one I know.
Yasuho Hirose... Height: 166 cm. She was standing on the ground...and she is the only person I know in this world.
Who the hell am I? I can't remember anything...
I just want to know what happened to me.
What're you saying? Help me understand it all, one thing at a time...
When my bubbles pop after touching you, they take something away from you.
You're gonna tell me everything. Got it?
Now, tell me! Who am I?!
Hey, Yasuho... think you can take a look at the other side?
I'll kick you around like a soccer ball all night if I have to. Just start making sense!
No reason for me to hang here. I'd better get going.
Maybe I just don't have a family.
I beat you!
Assist me!
Go on, get angry! You wanna fight? Then bring it on, pansy!
You're finished! Dammit! Dammiiiiit! Urrgh, I can't take it... I can't hold back my feelings anymore!
Hey! Wait! That's my shirt! Get your grubby fingers off it!
RERORERORERORERO!
Hey! You! Get your hands off my shirt right this second!!
Aaahh! Eh heh heh heh! Ah hah hah hah!
I want to sit next to him!
YEAH! Check this out!
C'mon, I bet you got some stupid excuse for that!
Just what do you take me for?
You wanna go?
Shuddup!
Who said you could talk to me?!
Puke, puke!
(mutter mutter)
Pleaaase make it a little bit cheaper!
I knew you were gonna go and do something stupid sooner or later!
This thing is past its expiration date!
Uhya hya hya hya!
...OK?
Stop acting all buddy-buddy!
Why?! Why in the hell...?! C'mon, I bet you got some stupid excuse for that!
Idiots like you always get bullied!
Who in their right mind would cross a dangerous bridge like that without any guarantee?!
Why meee?!
Hey! Who are you talking to? Us?
Aaahh! Eh heh heh heh! Ah hah hah hah!
What's wrong with you?!
You think you can make this better just by returning the money?! Just what do you take me for? Huh?!
You need to savor that sesame honey dumpling!
I don't believe in any god, you know...
What am I, a babysitter?!
Let's get things out in the open here!
People are so shallow these days. They merely act like they're following the rules. Nothing but superficial beauty...
Hey! Who said you could talk to me?!

Cairo, Egypt -1988-
After a long journey, Jotaro Kujo and his allies finally came face to face with their mortal enemy, DIO...
But none of them were any match for the overwhelming power of DIO's Stand.
Finally, just when Jotaro and DIO were the only two left standing,
DIO used Joseph's blood to power himself up.
Oh, this feels goo-oo-ood!
I feel so good I could sing. Hu hu hu hu ha ha ha ha!
It's been a hundred years since I first became immortal.
I've never felt as HIGH as this! HA HA HA HA!!
(Son of a bitch...)
WRYYAAAAA!
Urgh...
Now to finish you, Jotaro!!
Dammit!
Without further ado, it's time for the final strike! This is the absolute final time freeze!
Bring it...on... DIO...
Within these next nine frozen seconds, I'll finish you off once and for all!
Finish who off? That's my line, DIO!
Hmph! MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!!
Asshole!
How do you feel now? DIO...
I've never! EVER! Felt so perfectly wonderful...

Beating the living crap out of you and finishing you off here would only leave a bad aftertaste in my soul!
And yet...
Beating the living crap out of you and finishing you off here would only leave a bad aftertaste in my heart!
How many seconds until your leg heals? Three? Four?
Once it heals, I'm gonna sic Star Platinum on you, so bring it on!
Or, if I was a gunslinger from an old Western, I'd say...
Draw! Let's see who's the faster one!
(H... H... How dare he... make a fool out of ME...)
(But... But! Jotaro... Even though you've made it this far, you're still just a mere human... Heh heh heh...)
(You think like a human does - a human who only lives for a blink of an eye...)
(Worrying about stupid things like bad aftertastes and living a life with no regrets...)
(The way you think is as stupid as rat shit smeared all over a toilet, and now it's going to be the death of you! Heh heh heh heh!)
(I, DIO, possess none of that! All I have is one simple principle... Just one!)
(Win, and seize control! That's it! That alone is my satisfaction!)
(The process... The method...)
Nnnggh!
How's that?! I've blinded you with blood! Victory is mine! Now diiieee!
Oraaaa!
Wha...?!
Gwoaaaahhh?! Whaaaaat?!
Im...Impossible! H...How...How could I, DIO...
I, DIOOOOOOOO...
There's only...one reason you lost...DIO....
Just one simple reason...
You pissed me off.
You think I care about thaaaat?!
DIO / THE WORLD - Total Defeat... RIP
Kakyoin, Iggy and Avdol...
Jotaro overcame the noble sacrifices of his allies and defeated DIO, his fated enemy.
Exposed to the morning sun, DIO's body soon turned to dust and disappeared.
After surviving for 100 years, the evil emperor had finally been overthrown.
Afterwards...
What I need: My Stand.
A friend I can trust.
The souls of at least 36 people who have committed Ultimate Sins.
The 14 Phrases.
Courage.
My decaying Stand will gather up the souls of 36 Sinners, absorb them, and give birth to something new.
The last thing I need is a place.
The Time of Heaven...
Oh Jotaro, there you are!
The hospital contacted me. Looks like Jean Pierre's woken up, so let's go see him!
...
Hm? What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Go to Latitude 28°24' north, Longitude 80 °36' west... And wait for the next New Moon...
Heh heh... I found you, Jotaro Kujo, and your Star Platinum.
It's no wonder the Noble One told me to dispose of him... He possesses a Stand with unrivaled power. But...
He's still no match for our Stands...
Passengers for flight number 92 to Paris should proceed quickly to Gate 18...
Why go back to France, Jean Pierre?
You don't have any family left there, right? Why don't you come and stay with me in New York?
Mr Joestar... I may not have any more family in France, but it's still my homeland.
I have many fond memories attached to my hometown. Wherever my travelling takes me, I always end up back there.
If you ever need me, don't hesitate to call. I'll come running across the entire earth if I have to.
Well, I'll miss you.
...
...
We had our share of troubles, but...I had a really good time.
Traveling together made it fun.
...
I feel the same way...from the bottom of my heart.
Right, I'm off! Listen up, you old curmudgeon, you better not go dying any time soon, you hear me?
You and that heartless grandson of yours! You'd better not forget me!
We'll meet again! Unless you've had enough of me...you blasted fool!
I couldn't forget a character like you even if I wanted to...
Take care now...
...Later!
There they are! At last!
?
Hm?
Heh heh heh. It all makes sense now. Kinda...makes me want to laugh!
You're both so buff...
I knew at first glance that you're both descendants of Mr Joestar!
A friend of yours, Gramps?
No, I don't know who he is.
You're right, though. I am a Joestar... And who might you be?
Ohh, please excuse me. I'm...
Mr Joestar! Jotaro!
Gggghhh!
Jean Pierre?!
What's wrong? Why are you injured?! What's going on?!
I-I have no idea...
Not the slightest...goddamn...idea...
Enemies! They're coming for us!
Huh?
Wh...
...
...
What? Wh-what in the world?
Them! They're the ones! Watch out! They're going to attack!
Magician's Red!
GRRRRR!!
Avdol? Iggy?
I...I thought you were both dead... What in the hell...
I don't know what's going on, but we can't fight here!
There are too many innocent people around. Let's relocate!
What the?! They've already caught up with me?!
The clock is ticking. I need to hurry!
Gimme a break... What's going on, Jean Pierre? What is this?
No clue. When I tried to get on the plane for Paris, they suddenly appeared and came at me.
Urk... They caught up with us...
Want to keep running?
No, let's stay here and take them on.
There's no escape...
Grrrrrrrr!
Fools who dare to bring harm to the Noble One! I, Mohammed Avdol, will burn up every last piece of you!
The Noble One...?
Are you really Avdol? Or...
Step aside, Gramps.
I have no clue what's going on here, but there is one thing I know for sure...
They really are trying to kill us.
Mr Joestar, let me deal with them.
Avdol and Iggy died saving my life. I should be the one to slice up these lousy fakes!
Who the hell are you guys, anyway?
We will exterminate anyone who stands in the way of the Noble One...
Grrrrr...
Yo!
Judging by your face, you're dying to know who I am, so I thought I'd introduce myself...
But on second thought, not just yet!
In the beginning, the world was shrouded in flames.
Gimme a break... Guess I'll have to go all-out with you!
Magician's Red represents beginnings. The flames it controls are the beginning of everything!
Silver Chariot! I'll cleave the air and send those flames right back at you!
These flames, this sand... They both feel like...
Gimme a break... Why did you jackasses have to put us through all that?
Burn into cinders and begone!
Grrrr! Grrrrr!
For now, it doesn't matter who I am! Just concentrate on the battle that's kicking off in front of you!
Ooogh...
Ggh...
Now to find out who you really are.
Indeed. Time to bring out my Hermit Purple!
Hm?!
Wh-What's that light?
Avdol! Iggy!
They disappeared in a flash of light... What in the hell were they?
They are who they appeared to be, Mr Joestar.
I fought with them both, so I'm sure of it. They were the real Avdol and Iggy.
Don't be absurd. There's no way that could be. Although...
Who's there?!
I'm impressed. There aren't many who could fight those two off.
K...Kakyoin!
And you're...N'doul?
Heh heh heh...
Why are you so surprised? It's just the same as with Avdol and Iggy...
N'doul and I both swore our allegiance to the Noble One...
Which means...we must destroy you!
You too, Kakyoin?! What happened?!
Stand back, Jean Pierre. It's my turn now.
I won't let you get away this time. Hermit Purple will make you cough up everything!
Kakyoin teamed up with N'doul!?
I'm coming straight at you. You won't have space to breathe!
Impossible. You'll never get near us.
Heh... I'll pick him off like a fly!
My Hierophant Green...likes to hide in the shadows.
Are you...the real Kakyoin?
He's tracking our sounds so he can attack us!
I can hear you... I know right where you are!
I never imagined a long-distance Stand duo could be this dangerous...
Pfft. If we could only get closer, it'd be a piece of cake...
I told you already...you'll never get near us.
Now there is no one left to stand in our way.
Gramps!
Gffh...
Such...strength...
I swore to devote my life to the Noble One! I can't let myself die yet!
But I'll step down for now... Farewell, Joestars!
Damn it! They got away!
Not quite. I caught Kakyoin...
We'll deal with N'doul later. For now, I'll use Hermit Purple to check out Kakyoin.
Hold it!!
Not another one... Who the hell are you, now?
Wait, you're the guy we met at the airport...
Joseph, old fellow, this is a problem your powers can't solve.
Just leave it to me!
With the power of the Holy Corpse, I'll bring your friend back to normal!
What's that now?
Holy Corpse...?
Uggh... Where am I? Jotaro?
And Mr Joestar... Jean Pierre?
Have you come to your senses now, Kakyoin?
Ah!
I just remembered! DIO! DIO's ability! I figured out what his ability is!
!
You just calm down, Kakyoin. The battle with DIO's over now.
Who are you? How do you know my name?
What did you just do to Kakyoin? What the hell is going on here!?
Wait! Hold it! You need to calm down too.
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to introduce myself.
My name is Robert E.O. Speedwagon. I came here to make a request of you!
Speed...wagon?
That's the name of the founder of the Speedwagon Foundation!
I've got it! You're an amateur conman!
OH MY GOD!
No, Jean Pierre... I can hardly believe it, but I remember now. It really is him...
You look just like that photo I saw of Speedwagon when he was young!
You've seen me before? Good, that should make things quicker.
This is a part of the Holy Corpse.
A holey copse?
To put it simply, it's the mummified dead body of a great man who died a very long time ago.
The Holy Corpse has guided me through a plethora of different eras of history.
As we speak, our world is falling into a truly phenomenal crisis...
Which has given birth to all kinds of anomalies.
Just like what happened to that Kakyoin guy there.
You're saying that Kakyoin and Avdol came back to life because of anomalies?
Wow...
Don't worry about me, Mr Joestar.
My memory cuts off at the point when DIO attacked me and I was flung into a water tank...
But then why did Avdol and I attack Mr Joestar and the others? I want to know the truth...
Kakyoin. Who is the Noble One that you were talking about before?
Is he connected to the crisis that Speedwagon mentioned?
I don't know... I can't remember anything at all...
I'll give it to you straight. I want you to help me gather up the Holy Corpse parts!
There are nine Holy Corpse parts in total!
And they possess bizarre powers...
If we collect the other eight parts, we can build them into the Full Corpse and unleash its true power.
Then, we'll be able to fix all the anomalies and avert the crisis!
At least, I think we will.
You "think" we will?
Truth be told, I don't really know myself.
Since I came into possession of the corpse, I've been hearing voices whispering in my ear.
That's what led me here.
Whoa whoa whoa. Are you sure this guy's all there?
Wait, Jean Pierre. Let's hear him out.
The era I belong in was thrown into total chaos by those anomalies.
But I can't do anything about it by myself!
The Holy Corpse led me here so that I could meet you.
In other words, you must be the ones who are capable of stopping the crisis that threatens our world!
...I think.
Alright, that's it...
I know this is coming out of nowhere, but I'm begging you! Please fight alongside me!
Talk about surreal...
I've been through all kinds of bizarre adventures, but this is really a cut above the rest.
Well, what do you all think?
Gimme a break... It's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
I can't understand a thing he says, and I don't trust a word of it either!
But, he really did bring Kakyoin back to normal...
I trust him. I don't really see any other choice.
Hmm... There's no disputing the fact that Avdol, Iggy and N'doul really did attack us...
Okay, the verdict's in. Listen, up, Mr Speedwagon!
No, that sounds weird... Okay, Speedwagon! We've decided to help you out.
Thank you! What a relief.
Hm? Now what?
Look!
The Holy Corpse is resonating. That means that there's another corpse part nearby!
What?
Seems like there's another corpse part in the vicinity. Let's split up and find it!
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
So, what's this request of yours?
Look!
You've found the Holy Corpse (Body)!
Remember, this part of the corpse chose you. Be sure you don't lose it!
What's that?
It looks like a gap...like a rift made out of light...
These Light Rifts are created by the Holy Corpse parts.
Anyone who steps inside the Light Rifts can travel to a different era.
Right then, off we go! Just follow me!
Heh heh heh.
What's so funny, Jean Pierre?
I was just thinking...
If this goes well, Avdol and Iggy might come back to life! Just thinking about it made me smile...
I didn't expect to go on another journey together so soon...
Me either.
I'll say.
Gimme a break...
Itália -2001-
Como filho de DIO, Giorno Giovanna também herdou o sangue da família Joestar.
Depois de se tornar membro da gangue Passione, seu senso de justiça o tornou uma espécie de rebelde.
Depois de perder muitos aliados,
ele derrotou o chefe da gangue, Diavolo, em uma violenta batalha.
Onde estamos?
O Coliseu!
Você aprende essas coisas depois de viajar tanto quanto eu. Sim, Eu tenho certeza disso. É o mundialmente conhecido Coliseu da Itália!
Então teleportamos do Egito para a Itália?
E não é só isso. Olhe ao seu redor. Não lhe parece uma época diferente?
Hã? Cadê todo mundo?
Hmm...
Parece que eles foram para outro lugar.
O quê?
Quando muitas pessoas entram juntas numa fenda de luz, elas as vezes param em locais um pouco distantes.
Don't worry, though. The locations are never too far apart. I'm sure they're just a stone's throw away.
Let's take a walk around the Coliseum and see if we can find them.
Oh, but before that, let me explain something.
Whenever the corpse fixes an anomaly, it gains resonance power.
So if you find someone who's been caught up in an anomaly...
Be sure to liberate them with your corpse part, just like I did before.
Following the Holy Corpse's guidance is the quickest way to assemble it.
Gimme a break. Why didn't you say so sooner?
Hm? That's...
We finally...did it...
We did it, right? We won! Finally!
Bucciarati's got his soul back now, but his body is injured!
He must be dying to find out what happened to us in the Coliseum!
Come on, Giorno! Let's fix up Bucciarati and head back home!
Yeah... Let's go...
I'll be...right there...
?
Mista? Trish? Where are you?
They're gone! But they were here just a minute ago...
Heh...
Ah!
Bucciarati! You're okay?!
And here I was thinking your soul had already passed on...
I captured Mista and Trish. With my zippers, of course...
Now, Giorno...I just need you to die, and all my problems will be solved!
Zipper Man!
Gggh?!
Just now!
I touched him with Golden Wind and felt an incredible life force come gushing out of him!
I don't know why, but...this is someone else!
This Bucciarati...is not the same Bucciarati as before!
I will exterminate everyone who is capable of interfering with the Noble One!
The Noble One...? What are you talking about?
Gimme a break...
Looks like one of those anomalies is happening right in front of us...
Who is that?
Must be a tourist...
Get back, unless you want to get hurt. This is a world that members of the public don't need to know about.
Oh yeah? And what kind of a world would that be? Do tell.
I...warned you!
Zipper...!
Oraaaa!
Burrgh!
You're a...Stand User too?!
And a powerful one at that! You can punch faster than Zipper Man!
How dare you...
So you're...a Stand User as well?!
What power...what speed... It'd be too dangerous to take you head-on!
I'll leave you to the other two...
The other two?
Bucciarati!
He disappeared?!
Looks like he got away.
!
Is that...? It can't be! That looks like Narancia's Li'l Bomber!
A new Stand?
Find Narancia!
But I thought Narancia was dead!

Tch! How'd you get in so close?!
Narancia!
F...Fugo! You too?
Prepare yourself, Giorno...
You want to fight together, Fugo? You want to team up Li'l Bomber and Purple Smoke?!
Hey. You're a Stand user too, right?
Lend me a hand. We've got to get these guys back to normal.
I'm Jotaro Kujo. What's your name?
Giorno...Giovanna...
My virus will free you from your pain...
Two beehives, coming right up!
We can turn them back to normal? How?
I'll explain later. First we need to stop them.
Time to die, Giorno!
Fugo... What are you doing here?
You're not half bad.
What a Stand... It has both overwhelming power and super-precise movements...
If you catch this virus...you're done for. There's no cure.
You're both going straight to hell!
Very well...
Urgh...
He's too strong... I can't believe someone like him exists! I can't let him get any closer...
I need to escape and rethink my plan!
Please! Wait, Fugo!
He's gone!
Guess we lost him. At least we got one.
H-Huh? What's going on? ...Giorno?
Narancia! You know who I am?
W-What was I just doing?
Jotaro!
What just happened here?
I found one of those anomalies.
Hm?
Look!
I guess it's telling me to chase after those two.
Gramps, Kakyoin, keep an eye that guy.
We'll chase after the pair who escaped inside the light. You coming?
This will lead us to Bucciarati?
Very well. Let's go!
This is...Neapolis Train Station!
We moved from the Coliseum to Neapolis Train Station?!
They must be around here somewhere. Let's hurry up and find them.
Search the stage!
Is that...
Oh, Jotaro! I found you!
What are you doing here, Jean Pierre?
And what's that?
This turtle? It was on the other side of the platform!
I thought if I left it there, someone might step on it, so I brought it over here to the water fountain.
Jotaro, what's going on?
Who is that?
This is Giorno Giovanna. He got caught up in this era's anomalies.
(I feel like I've seen this guy before somewhere... Hmmm...)
Let me introduce you, Giorno. This is... Hm?!
I didn't think you'd chase me this far!
Bucciarati!
You came here through the Light Rifts, didn't you?
I see... You're collecting the Holy Corpse parts too!?
So that's an anomaly. I just need to beat him to a pulp and then shine the corpse's light on him, right?
Yeah, but he's got a close-range power type Stand. Be careful.
Okay! Leave it to me!
Fine! If you want to fight, then so be it! I won't hold back...
And I've called on an ally who won't hold back either!
An ally...?
Jean Pierre...
Wha!! Whaaaat!?
Y-you're...Cool Ice!
What's wrong? Why do you look so surprised...
If you lose your cool...it means you're afraid.
You're...AFRAID of me...aren't you?
Shut the hell up! Jotaro, let me take this guy!
I'll fight with you!
This time, I'll cut you into so many pieces you'll never be able to come back again!
Bucciarati. I'm going to defeat you...for your own sake.
You won't escape this time. I'll stop you no matter what it takes...
Your life ends here, Giorno Giovanna!
Bucciarati... I hope you're "prepared" for this.
You're the ones who should prepare yourselves...prepare to be scattered across the ground in tiny pieces, that is!
You scumbag! I'll slice you into dust as many times as I need to!
Oh no you won't! This time it's your turn to become dust...in my dark void!
Please wake up, Bucciarati!
Now make sure you go to hell this time!
Farewell, Giorno.
Jean Pierre was crushed into tiny pieces...and died...
Your sword...is just as sharp as before...
Heh heh...You know, I like you...
Jean Pierre! My Stand is going to swallow and kill you!
What!? Hey, hold up!
Giorno Giovanna... Your ability truly is dangerous...
But I won't let this happen again...
Bucciarati!
He got away...
Hold on. Was that Cool Ice guy...
Yes! He's the son of a bitch who killed Avdol and Iggy!
The anomalies must have brought him back to life as well! Even though I lured him out into the sunlight and turned him into dust!
Wait. Something isn't right...
I thought DIO's blood had turned him into a vampire...
Which means there's no way he'd be able to stand out here in broad daylight...
Maybe he's actually someone else?
Take Bucciarati, for instance. The man with the zippers...
Logically, his body should have no life energy at all right now...
Yet when we just fought, he was brimming with it.
They're the same, but different! That's the only way to explain it...
Except that doesn't explain anything...
Honestly, we don't really understand what's going on either.
We came here with a guide who's supposed to know what's what, but he's kind of...sketchy.
Look, the Holy Corpse is resonating!
There must be a Holy Corpse part somewhere in this station.
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
The Noble One would be so pleased if I exterminated you...
Enough with the Noble One crap! Who the hell is he?
Heh heh heh...
The only man in the world who I swear allegiance to...
Whaaat?
L-Look!
You've found the Holy Corpse (Head)!
Good, we found the corpse part...
Erm, how many parts of the Holy Corpse were there again?
Speedwagon said there were nine in total.
Sheesh! This is gonna take a while...
Whoa! You found the Holy Corpse part already?!
Sorry it's taken me so long to get here. I found these two by the Coliseum,
and it took me a while to explain the situation.
Giorno!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Mista! Trish!
I see... When Bucciarati disappeared, the zippers must have worn off.
Hey, tell me something. Why did Bucciarati come after us?
And how did Narancia come back to life?
What's going on here? I-I don't remember a thing...
I don't really know myself.
But you do, don't you, Mr...umm...
It's Speedwagon.
Let's save the details for later, shall we? Basically, we're collecting the Holy Corpse parts,
and we need your help!
Please! Lend us your strength!
Let me just ask one thing.
The light from the <color red>Holy Corpse</color> can return Bucciarati and Fugo back to normal...
Correct?
Yes, that's right!
...
Very well. In that case, let us assist you.
What about that turtle?
Oh, yeah, check this out!
I heard about it from Mista and Trish. This turtle's shell is connected to some mysterious space.
Inside is a wide room that can fit several people inside!
If we use this turtle, we can prevent ourselves from getting split up by the Light Rifts!
Just watch! This is how you go in.
He disappeared! Is this some kind of Stand power? Don't tell me the turtle has a Stand too!
Please, wait!
Hm? Me?
It's been bugging me for some time, but I've finally figured it out.
I know who you are!
Who I am? What are you talking about?
You're Jean Pierre the turtle guy, aren't you?
...
Say what now?
He is, isn't he? I was thinking the exact same thing!
Me too! You're the one who switched souls with the turtle!
Switched souls with the turtle!?
You look a lot younger than you did when you were with the turtle, though.
"When I was with the turtle"!?
Now wait one minute here. This isn't making any sense. It almost sounds like you think I turned into a turtle or something...
Is this some kind of Italian joke? Ha ha ha...
Hey... Maybe we shouldn't have mentioned it.
Hmm. Yeah, it's just, there's been so much weird shit happening lately that I've gotten desensitized!
I guess if you think about it logically, turning into a turtle is a pretty shocking thing. Maybe we should have just kept quiet?
G-Giorno... You're the one who brought this up. You fix it!
Very well.
I'm sorry. What I said before was just a figment of my imagination... Please forget about it.
So, Jotaro. We're to get inside the turtle, correct? I'll go in first.
Yeah, all that stuff was just made up.
Sorry about that...
You're never gonna turn into a turtle! Just relax.
Hey, wait a damn minute! You need to explain yourselves clearly, or this is going to bug me forever!
I feel a bit confused myself...
It seems like Jean Pierre and that group have some kind of connection. Their destinies are intertwined somehow...
Gimme a break...
Kakyoin's already inside the turtle.
Now, let's enter the Light Rift.
So...he was guided here by the Holy Corpse...
Giorno Giovanna...
Japan -1999-
In Morioh Town, S City, there lives a high school delinquent named Josuke Higashikata.
With the help of his friends, he took on a fearsome serial killer named Yoshikage Kira
and successfully defeated him.
We're...back in Japan?
This town!
I remember it! At least, I think I do. Could it possibly be...?
What is it, Gramps?
...
Oh, no, nothing at all. Let's get looking for those Holy Corpse parts, shall we?!
?
Huh? What the...
Okuyasu said he's got a cold, but he's obviously just skipping!
I'm gonna go to his house and teach him a lesson!
What are you talking about? We're just going to see how he's doing!
Huh?
Holy crap! Koichi, look at this!
That guy looks exactly like Jotaro!
...
Who the hell is that? By the looks of that uniform, he isn't from around here.
They say that everyone has three doppelgangers... But that one looks a bit too similar...
Hey, Josuke...
Maybe it isn't Jotaro's doppelganger. Maybe it's the real Jotaro!
No way. They look similar, but that guy's way too young.
Are you sure?
Hey!
Y-yes, how may I help you?
I have a question for you... Have you noticed any strange things happening around there?
Strange things? In Morioh Town?
(I-I've no idea what he wants from me, but...)
(Because of all the Stand users here, it's nothing but strangeness 24/7...)
(The fact that I'm talking to Jotaro's doppelganger is strange enough to begin with...)
...
Okuyasu! What are you walking around outside for? I knew you were faking it!
You're gonna pay...
Huh?
You're gonna pay for getting in our way...
The Hand!!
Huh!?
Star Platinum... I stopped time.
Gimme a break... Another Stand User caught in an anomaly?
(W-What was that? Star Platinum The World?!)
O-Okuyasu? What are you doing?!
I see. This is what you could do when you were at your peak...in 1988.
!
Rohan...?
It's truly fascinating. Before I do away with you, I think I'll make you into a book and read it.
Of course, that goes for you too, Koichi and Josuke.
Hey, Rohan! Cut the crap! You're not making any sense, man!
You are all obstacles in the path of the Noble One. Therefore...
I'm going to take you all out...
Okuyasu! Rohan!
Looks like they're serious. Koichi! Use your Stand to protect yourself!
We have no choice. Let's do this!
Why? Why do we have to fight Okuyasu and Rohan?
Okuyasu Nijimura's The Hand is going to wipe you all out!
I'll write it in right now. You will all "die here..."
Bring it on, losers!
Okuyasu! Cut it out before I lose my temper!
Resistance is futile, Koichi...
What has gotten into you two?
A-are you two...o-okay?
Don't worry, Koichi. I'll fix them both right up.
Say goodbye, Josuke Higashikata and Koichi Hirose!
I'm gonna swipe you right out of this world!

Urghie...
Ggh... How pathetic... I think it's time I took my leave...
Wait up. I'm not finished yet.
Ah!
Waaah!
Urrrgggh... You prick!
Okuyasu! Stop right there!
Argh... Koichi? Wh-What's going on?
R-Rohan? A-Are you okay now?
Take care of him for me.
I'm going after the one who ran. He went that way, right?
Yes! Thank you so much, Jotaro! Please bring Okuyasu back to normal too!
...
Hey...how do you know my name?
Huh? Oh, I guess it just slipped out...
Are you really Jotaro?!
B-But why do you look as young as a high school student?!
What do you mean...young?
...
!
Oh, Jotaro...
Japan is bigger than I thought. I ended up getting lost! Hah hah hah...
Gramps. I just met up with some guys who've met us in the future.
This Morioh Town is over ten years further in the future than the era we came from.
Hm?
Oh... You're that guy from before...
Josuke Higashikata... Koichi told me your name.
FLINCH!
Where did your pal Okuyasu go?
I dunno. I chased him back here, but...
His body kinda flashed, then vanished...
...
Hey, you used your Stand to stop time back there, right?
Are you...
Jotaro Kujo?
Yeah.
Whoaaa! No way!
...Hm?
What the?!
Th-That's... Harvest!
!
What are all those tiny things?!
But I thought Shigechi was dead!
W-Wait!
Chase down Harvest!
Shee shee! That was the perfect lure!
My Harvest is invincible! I'm 'unna beat you all up!
Th-This can't be happening! Shigechi?!
Heh heh heh heh heh. I'm gonna look so cool when I kill you!
Urk! Y-you're... Akira Otoishi!
What are Shigechi and Otoishi doing together?!
They may look like your friends, but don't let your guard down. As of now...they're enemies!
I'm 'unna smash you into splithereens!
Get ready, guys!
This is real rock!
Let it throttle your soul!
My Harvest is really, really strooong!
No one can beat my Harvest!
Shee shee shee! Now the Noble One will give me lots of compliments!
I finally expressed...my heart! And the scream of my soul!
Aieeee! Y-You're really strong...
I-I'm getting outta here!
Shigechi, wait! Hey, Otoishi! Get back here, you asshole!
They're gone... It's just like with Okuyasu...
Jotaro, you have to tell me what's going on here.
What happened to Okuyasu and Rohan?
Why is Shigechi alive again? Why are you young again?
...
Explaining is such a pain in the ass...
Gramps, take it away.
What?
Get in the turtle and explain, will you?
M-Meee!?
I can't just perform at a moment's notice like that... I-I need to make the proper preparations...
I hate reptiles. There's no way I'm going near that thing.
...
Shut your mouth and get your ass over there!
Waah! The young Jotaro is scary!
I-I can't...I really c-can't...
Gimme a break...
I still haven't seen another Light Rift yet...
Does that mean there's still something else we have to do in this era?
Hm?
Jotaro!
Koichi. And Rohan, was it?
I see! Yes, amazing!
Yes, if I had to draw a picture of what I imagined Jotaro had looked like ten years ago, it might look exactly like him!
Would you mind if I sketched you, Mr Jotaro?
I know that I'm older than you now, but it feels weird for me not to call you that...
...
Did you forget what you just did to me?
And you also mentioned the Noble One...
Yes, so I heard. Koichi told me I was saying some strange things.
But I don't remember anything now. I have no idea what that was all about.
It's like there's a mist in my head that's preventing me from remembering anything.
(Sounds just like Kakyoin... They can't remember anything that happened while the anomaly was affecting them...)
Koichi...
Oh, Yukako!?
Here you are! It sure took me a while to find you...
You really made me waste a lot of time! I'm going to rip you all to shreds!
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
I see. So that's what an anomaly looks like. Perhaps I'll observe this for a bit...
I'm going to crush you, Koichi!
Yukako Yamagishi... I used to respect how much you adored Koichi...
Yukako! Snap out of it!
Yukako... What happened to you?
Koichi! You need to die! For me!
Yukako! Please, just listen a minute!
No! You're the one who has to listen to what I say!
It seems like her emotions have gotten out of control...or perhaps "distorted" is the better word?
Yukako! Why are you doing this?! What's happened to our town?!
I love you... So I'll make sure that your death is as painless as possible...
Sounds like he knows the 1988 me...
Just you wait...Koichi...
I'm going to smush you if it's the last thing I do!
Yukakooo!
What happened to you?! It's like you've gone back to your old self...
All that abusive language...and attacking me...
Really? I don't really see much of a change...
Rohan! That's mean!
Hm?
Hyahahahaha hya hya hya!
You're...Enyaba!
Ohhh, I can't tell you how pleased I am! So delighted to see you...Jotaro...
Now I'll be able to eliminate you with my own two hands, you despicable wreeetch!
Who's that old lady?
She's a Stand user who can control people's bodies with mist.
Looks like she's brought a bunch of dead bodies along with her...
D-Dead b-b-bodies?
Kweeeeeehhhh!!
Go get them!
Keh keh keh keh keh keh keh!
If that's all you can manage, then you'll never defeat Justice! Heeeee hee hee hee hee!
It's no use resisting! Kyah kyah keh keeeh!
The Noble One is justice itself! Therefore, I am bound to win!
Justice always wins out in the end!
Gghkeekeekeeeee!
Curse you, Jotaro! Why must you always stand in my way?!
You're all no more than specks of dust in the face of the Noble One...
Enough, you old bag! Who's this Noble One you keep going on about?
You'll meet him soon enough. In your final houuuuur!
Tch....
Okay. Let's leave all the details and crap for later.
We're traveling around looking for parts of something called a Holy Corpse.
It'd be a big help if you'd lend us a hand.
But of course! There's no way I'd miss out on such an amusing spectacle.
If it will help bring Okuyasu and Yukako back to normal, then you can count me in too!
(Okay! Don't get so worried!)
Where's that voice coming from?
(This is the second time now! What does it matter what I call her? Mom, old bag, what's the damn difference?)
(Enough already, man!)
?
(I'm going out for a breath of air. Let's just try and get along, okay, Macho Gramps?)
(M-Macho Gramps?)
Huh? Josuke came out of the turtle?!
Oh! Koichi and Rohan!
This turtle is pretty cool! The inside is like a room in a spaceship! It's killer!
Go on, try it out!
A spaceship? Inside that filthy turtle?
Waaahhh!!
Ahh! Rohan!
Hm?!
What is it?
The corpse is resonating... Looks like there's a Holy Corpse part somewhere nearby!
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
Whaaat? You don't even know that much? You rotten little pissant!!
The Noble One is a king among kings! The one who is fit to control the entire world!
If you took him on, you'd be overwritten in a second and disappear forever...
"Overwritten"...?
Not that you'd understand what that means... Keh keh keh keh keh!
Still, there's no need for you to hurry... You'll meet him in due time...
Overwritten? What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Just who could the Noble One be?
Someone that Enyaba and N'doul would pledge their allegiance to...
No... It couldn't be...
Jotaro, what's that weird light?
It's...
Gah! A mummy?!
You got the Holy Corpse (Left Arm)!
It's so dry and flaky... Eww, it gives me the creeps!
Hey, be careful. That's your part of the Holy Corpse right there.
Yeah, I did hear about that inside the turtle...
There are nine parts in total...and we have to collect them...and this is the fourth part, right?
Yeah.
Hey, it flashed!
I'm going to show it to Rohan and creep him out.
Gimme a break...
Hey, Jotaro!
I found something cool inside the turtle.
Something cool?
This camera.
If we use this camera with Mr Joestar's Hermit Purple...
We should be able to reveal the one behind all this in a photograph!
Yes! Time to find out who the ringleader is!
Here goes...
Hermit Purple!
!
Ahh!
N...No! It can't be!
D...DIO?!
That's crazy! It can't be DIO... There's no way!
Mr Joestar. Are you sure you didn't put too much power into your Stand?
No...
Gramps. Your Stand never makes mistakes.
I've been wondering about it for a while...
There's only one person who N'doul and Enyaba would pledge allegiance to, and that's DIO.
But we turned him into dust ourselves!
Just look at me. I'm supposed to be dead as well...
Nngh...
You're right... The same goes for Cool Ice...
The only man he serves is DIO...
I don't know how,
but that bastard DIO is back alive, and he's pulling the strings from the shadows...
At least, that's what we should assume for now...
I'm going to step back inside the turtle for a bit.
At the end of the 19th century, there lived a British aristocrat named Jonathan Joestar...
In order to defeat Dio, who had turned into a vampire,
Jonathan teamed up with his sworn friend Speedwagon and the Hamon master Zeppeli, and threw himself into a fight against the undead.
This is the story of the destiny that Jonathan and Dio shared, and their battle for the stone mask.
This is where it all began...
Are we...inside a building? This doesn't look Japanese...
Whaaaat?!
(What the hell was that?)
Seems like...I wasn't damaged...
(Huh... Where are we?)
What?
(panting)
Hm?! That's...
Mr Joestar!
Mr Joestar! You're alive!?
Speedwagon!?
Keep back! You mustn't get any closer.
Urgh!
Y-you! It's Dio!!
Nnnn?!
I know you... You're that maggot named Speedwagon...
(So this is how DIO looked back then...)
(And that man must be my ancestor, Jonathan Joestar...)
The other one is a fresh face, though. Not as if it matters, though...JoJooo!
Allow me to commend you! You've held out well against all of my spectres of the night.
But my supply of zombies is inexhaustible! There are still plenty more to come!
Ggh! I have to keep my Hamon breathing steady...
Mr Joestar, this is bad... All this battling has left you exhausted...
Charge, zombieees! Make him scream out a fanfare for you!
No! I won't let this happen!
You! You're one of the allies that Speedwagon found, right?
I'll introduce myself later.
Feed on his flesh! Suck up the marrow of his bones!
I've got to get my breathing under control... My Hamon breathing!
JoJo! Give up your struggle and become a part of my life force!
Gimme a break... I'm so sick of fighting moving corpses...
Zombies! What are you doing!? Hurry up and finish him off!
Things will never end at this rate... Bring out the boss already!
What kind of ability is that? You seem to be overflowing with energy! I sense an overwhelming power from you!
Goodbye, JoJooo!
This is my era! This building is...Mr Joestar's...

What?!
He's ploughing through the zombies as if they were made of paper...
Where did you get that...ability?
What's wrong? Looks like you're having some trouble here.
Huh...?
!!
Who's that? It looks like Dio, but...
Tch... Diego Brando?
Diego Brando?! Are you Dio's...big brother?
Heh. I guess that's the limit of people's creativity in this era.
Hey. Enough with the small talk!
Who said you were in charge? We're equals. That was the deal, right?
...
...
Hmph! So be it. I'll deal with you later...
My first priority is to put an end to JoJo!
JoJo... So he's this world's Johnny Joestar...
Huh? What are you blathering about?
...
Okay, I'll lend a hand. How about we team up and take them out together?
Mr Joestar is too exhausted! We'll have to fight in his place!
Don't fail me now, monster...
You're the monster, you miserable excuse for a human...
Dinosaurs were the monsters who controlled our world in ancient times.
No one can slip past their kinetic vision!
KWAHHH! I'll suck up your life force!
In place of your life force, your arteries will be pumping with my vampiric essence!
MUDA MUDAAAAAA!
Weak! So weaaak! My zombies will eat off your pale little faces!
To think that there would come a day when I, Dio, would be made to kneel to mere humans! Y...You'll pay for this! Nnngggh...
Don't think you've won this!
One day! I'll get every last one of you! I'll cut you all up and make you into a feast for my zombies!
Hey, are you two also working for the Noble One?
Are you out of your mind? Our alliance is only temporary.
One day, I'll finish Dio off once and for all... And the same goes for you.
In the end, I, Diego, shall claim total victory!
What...?
Dammit! He ran away!
Urrrgghhh...
Mr Joestar! Are you alright?!
I let the Holy Corpse guide me and gathered allies, just like you told me to!
Speedwagon, now that you mention it, I don't think you've told us anything about yourself yet.
How is it that the Holy Corpse is guiding you?
...
Mr Joestar's compatriots and I intended to make way for
a small town called Wind Knight's Lot.
We'd heard that after turning into a vampire, Dio had been hiding out there, you see.
But just before we could get there, the anomalies appeared in our age!
The Joestar Residence, which burned to the ground in a fire, was suddenly resurrected and became swarming with zombies!
This thing first appeared at Mr Joestar's place...
However, Mr Joestar stayed back to fend off the zombies,
and I wanted to stay with him and fight too, of course,
but he handed me the Holy Corpse part, and told me to travel around the other ages to collect the rest of it.
Thank you...Speedwagon. I'm fine now.
Hamon is life energy. If I can just get my breathing under control, then I can restore a good bit of my stamina.
Mr Joestar, I'm sorry it took so long to bring help.
I was really in danger back there, but you saved me.
Thank you for saving my life. My name is Jonathan Joestar.
Who are you?
...
Jotaro Kujo...
O-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!
Nnnn?!
Jotaro Kujo, Jonathan Joestar, and the corpse guide, Speedwagon...
I'm going to execute you all right here!
Who the hell are you?
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this the first time we've met?
I'm one of The Nine Egyptian Gods... Mariah, of Bastet!
The Nine Egyptian Gods? You're one of N'doul's allies?
If you want to fight, then I'll take you on.
Tee hee...
Is that... No way!
You've already fallen into Bastet's trap!
Anyone who touches my Stand becomes imbued with a strong magnetic force that grows stronger and stronger as time passes...
There's no escaping now!
Get close to Mariah!
The magnetic force will just keep on increasing...
Until eventually it wrenches your body apart...
The power of my Bastet is already...
far greater than your Star Platinum!!
So your Stand can control magnetic force... Pretty cool.
Still, you've got some nerve to come here and take us on all alone.
...
Hoh-hoh-hoh! All alone?
JoJo! You will pay for putting Hamon to ill use!
Zeppeli...?!
Who...?
Mr Joestar's mentor... A Hamon master!
Anyone who defies the Noble One is too foolish to be redeemed! I should have never taught you about Hamon in the first place!
I can't believe it! Mr Zeppeli! You're being affected by an anomaly too?!
Mr Joestar! You can't fight in that state!
No...I must. I have to wake Mr Zeppeli up!
Gimme a break...
Mr Zeppeli! I'm going to go all-out!
Catching her is going to be the hard part...
It's a master's duty to see that his disciples' errors are set straight! Bring it on!
The magnetic force will keep getting stronger and stronger... Until it splats you like a pancake, Jotaro!
In order to erase his Hamon, I need to hit it with another large Hamon blast!
The only thing that's going to be erased here is you, JoJo!
I get it. Your trick is to maintain a steady distance through the battle...
Tee hee... Too bad it took you so long to figure out...
What's wrong? You two done already?
Mr Zeppeli, I trust you. That's why I've given this battle my all...
There's nothing so pitiable as an unworthy disciple... At least I can put you to rest with my own hand!
You two looked pretty handsome out there.
Gfffh!
I see your skills have improved a great deal... Impressive!
But next time we meet, I'll end this once and for all!
Ggh! Ggggh! How dare you...
You're going to regret this, you...tiny little turds!
Mr Zeppeli, please wait!
They're gone...
I'll bring you back to normal, Mr Zeppeli... I promise...
Mr Joestar...
I want you to take this.
I've taken care of it up until now, but it belongs to you!
Speedwagon...
Urgh...
Mr Joestar! Are you okay?!
Sorry. Seems I'm a bit tired...
And no wonder! You've been holding out on your own all this time!
Jotaro, bring out the turtle! We'll have him take a rest inside.
So, have you collected all the corpse parts, Jotaro?
What is it, Gramps?
I was enjoying the sofa in there when Speedwagon came and kicked me out.
"We need to let Mr Joestar rest," he said.
I'm a Mr Joestar too, you know!
Gimme a break.
-1938-
Led by the destiny he inherited from his grandfather Jonathan, Joseph encountered the Pillar Men.
The Pillar Men were in search of a mysterious stone known as the "Red Stone of Aja."
If they succeeded in obtaining the stone, the entire world would be at their mercy.
In order to take on these powerful foes, Joseph teamed up with Zeppeli's grandson, Caesar,
and began training under the supervision of Lisa Lisa, a Hamon master.
Where are we this time? An island? I can hear the sound of waves...
This is...Air Supplena Island!
You know this place, Gramps?
Yes. It's where I did my Hamon training, 50 years ago...
Wow, this really takes me back. I might try doing some Hamon breathing...
Kaaaaaaaa...
So you can show us the way around, then?
Of course!
...Or so I'd like to say, but it was a whole 50 years ago. Unfortunately, my memories have gotten a bit blurry...
Gimme a break...
Hm? What's going on over there?
Kaaaaaaaa...
Kaaaaaaaa...
Huh?
What happened, JoJo? Are you worn out already?
No, I see people over there.
What?
I think that guy is... Yes! There's no mistaking him!
That's my old friend Caesar! Caesar Zeppeli!
...
...
(Who's that sweaty little brat?)
(Who's this mangy old fart?)
(Ah! It's me! That must be me!)
(It sure is weird to see your own face from fifty years ago...)
Gramps... You mean that punk over there is you when you were young?
Don't you call me a punk!
What are you whispering about?
Yeah, and who are you guys? This island is private property, y'know.
Caesar... JoJo...
Lisa Lisa, we've found some intruders.
It seems unlikely...but it's possible they might be working with the Pillar Men.
You both have to die! Immediately!
Huh?
Y-You want to kill...us?!
Her Hamon is overflowing with bloodlust!
L-Lisa Lisa! What's come over you?
Gimme a break... Another anomaly?
Hey, Caesar! I'm not sure what's going on, but it looks bad!
That attack just now was serious!
B-But why would Lisa Lisa...
Get ready! ...HUH?!
Heh heh heh heh heh...
Look how fit and healthy you look... Yes, you certainly have matured, Joestar!
What the? What's the German army doing here?
No! It can't be...
Stroheim!
JoJo... I crawled back up from Hell!
But Stroheim got blown to bits in Mexico! How are you here right now?!
They do say that Germany is hiding some crazy medicine and science and preparing for war, but...
Is that how you survived, Stroheim?!
Wroooooong again, JoJo!
What? Really?
I was resurrected thanks to the power of the Noble One, and I'm stronger than ever...
In other words... Forget about humanityyyy! I've surpassed every being that exiiiiists!
Say hello to Stroheim, the Perfect Life Form!
Y...You're not making any sense...
But if Lisa Lisa and Stroheim are teaming up, that means there's something very strange going on here!
Prepare yourself, JoJoooo!
We have no choice, Caesar! Let's fight them!
Nnnngh... You're right.
Lisa Lisa! Stroheim! Let's go!
Lisa Lisa...I'm going to fight back now!
Death to the Hamon amateurs!
You shall praise my perfectioooon!
Prepare to die!
Lisa Lisa! Why are you doing this?!
Goddammit, Stroheim! Is your entire body a machine now?!
German soldierrrrs neverrr kneeeel!
Forgive me, Lisa Lisa!
Does this mean we completed the final test already?
With Hamon skills that poor, you deserve to die!
Even my name is wonderful! "RUDOL VON STROHEIMMM!"

Mmmggh...
Not bad, JoJo. Heh heh... HAH HAH HA!
WAAAH HAH HAH! We will meet again!
Ooogh...
Lisa Lisa! Are you okay?
Caesar, you idiot! If you get too close she'll blast you with her Hamon!
How can you just leave her like this? We have to tend to her!
Out of the way.
What?
Wow...
W-What happened to me?
Master! You've returned to your senses!
Hey you! What did you just do?
We're looking for parts of the Holy Corpse, like this one.
I know that there's one somewhere on this island. I want to find it.
Huh? Hey, I asked you a question!
Urrghh...
Lisa Lisa!
I guess I owe you one for bringing Lisa Lisa back.
But this island is private property. You can't just go wandering around by yourselves.
JoJo! Go with these guys, will you?
I'll take Lisa Lisa back to her room.
I'll help.
No thanks. You don't seem to be our enemies, but I'm still suspicious of you.
Forgive me for this, Master.
C'mon, grandpa! You're in the way. Get back...
Huh?!
(I just felt Hamon! Does this old man really know how to use Hamon...?)
(More importantly... It feels like...)
(I know him from somewhere!)
(No... I know his Hamon!)
JoJo, I'll be back as soon as I've taken Lisa Lisa to her room.
Hey, old man! Just who are you?
I know you're a Hamon user.
But your Hamon is just...like...
You hear that, Gramps? Time to explain.
Why is it always me who has to do the explaining?
Can you think of someone better to do it?
Grrmm...
Okay. I guess I'll start with some introductions.
My name is Joseph Joestar.
WHAAAAT!?
This punk here is Jotaro, my grandson.
...
We've come from an age half a century in the future.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
The future? Seriously? Have you two gone kooky or something?
Yeah... I guess anyone would react that way.
But maybe if I show you this...
You'll believe me when I say that we came here from the future.
Jotaro, get the turtle...
Hey, Speedwagon! Can you come over here for a minute?
Huh? Speedwagon?
You rang?
Gaaaah!
H-H-He came...out of the turtle?!
And that face!
I've seen it before, in Grandma Erina's old pictures!
Hm? Who's this lad?
It's me when I was younger.
I wanted to show him your face to help him understand the situation a bit better.
Wow. He looks just like Mr Joestar!
I'd like to have a chat with him...
But at the moment I'm a bit busy taking care of Mr Joestar so that he can rest up properly.
See ya later, Joseph!
Talk about a one-two punch!! This is freakier than seeing any kind of ghost...
A young Speedwagon!
And then an old man claiming to be "me from the future"! Both standing right in front of my eyes!
Well, what do you say? I know there's no use in hurrying you, but...
...
No, it's okay. I get it.
Feeling your Hamon and seeing Speedwagon has convinced me.
It's pretty hard to believe... But I guess I can't disbelieve it either...
Tell me, though - why are you here? You were saying something about corpses?
That's right. We...
Hm?!
Hey you! What are you doing?
Hmm... No sign of her here...
I heard there was a super hot chick living on this island. I was looking forward to meeting her...
Huh?
I know that face! You're...Hol Horse!
Oh, Jotaro. I'm mighty pleased you remember me.
I'm here with my comrade Centerfold under the Noble One's orders...
Seize the Holy Corpse! And get rid of the lousy bunch who are getting in our way! Those are the orders, see...
Hm. So the other one's hiding?
Just cut the crap and come at me.
Let's take these guys out and reap the rewards, Mr Centerfold!
Hol Horse... Spread more water around!
Aye aye, sir! Here's a shipful for you!
Ready to finish this, Mr Centerfold?
Heh heh... Very well. Bring them to me...
When Mr Centerfold's Hanged Man and my Emperor team up, no one stands a chance!
Ggh!
Geeeyaaaah!
The one with the mirror Stand is over there!
Hey, why are you attacking us? Are you guys collecting the corpse parts too?
Hee hee... You haven't realized? How sad...
It should be obvious why the Noble One would want to eliminate you...
Wait!
Farewell, Jotaro. Farewell, Joestar!
Give my love to the lady of the island. It's a real pity I won't get to meet her...
H-He disappeared just like Stroheim did...
What's wrong, JoJo?
Are you guys our enemies after all?!
No, Caesar. That's not it...
(What should I say? Explaining everything would be such a pain in the ass...)
These guys are guests of mine. It's been so long that I completely forgot them, but they're old friends.
Old friends?
...
JoJo, are you trying to hide something from me?
It appears...this island is deserted...
Although the arena does look interesting...
Huh?
WHAAAAT!?
!
The woman with the Red Stone of Aja...
must be on the next island...
I'm the only one here...
Seems like Kars and Wamuu haven't figured out that the stone is in this area.
You son of a bitch! You've found Lisa Lisa already?!
Esidisi!!
How is he...doing that? It's like he's not human!
Hoh...
I see... So you just arrived as well...
Wamuu!
Hm?
!
Master Esidisi...
OHHH NOOO!
This is bad! Now Wamuu's here! Two Pillar Men at the same time...
(OH! NO! Not only Esidisi but Wamuu as well?!)
Forgive me for interrupting...
But Master Kars has already arrived...
Heh...
Oh! Kars! You too?
Th-Three Pillar Men at once! You've gotta be kidding me... We're in deep shit!
(OH! MY! GOD!)
(Even Kars is here?!)
(What's going on here? This isn't the past as I remember it!)
!
Kars...!
Kars, the stone isn't here. It's on the next island.
Yes, so it would seem...
In that case, let's dispose of this trash and then get moving.
Master Kars, Master Esidisi...
I made a promise in Rome to duel with that JoJo man over there...
Please allow me to fight him!
Wait, Wamuu...
It appears his Hamon skills have improved a fair deal....
Let me play with him a bit first, will you?
...
Y...
No! This won't do!
You're both forgetting what our objective is here: To obtain the Red Stone of Aja! That, and nothing else!
We can just let the vampires deal with them.
Huh? The VAMPIRES?
Sounds good to me. This is a chance to test what we've learned in our training.
Vampires or no vampires, I'll destroy them all at once!
Goddammit! You guys are gonna pay for this!
Don't talk more than necessary. Remember your breathing.
Vampires! Exterminate them!
That's the way, JoJo! You've got a good rhythm going.
Leave it to me! I'll crush them all in no time!
I can do it! My breathing is steady! I'm not even tired!
Yes! I can maintain my Hamon at the perfect level!
I can really sense the fruits of all our hard work...
Our Hamon have gotten stronger!
Let's move out... Tonight, the Red Stone of Aja will be ours!
Nnnnn?!
Just half a month ago, your Hamon abilities were below par...
And yet now you can polish off a whole team of vampires in a matter of minutes. How is that possible?
GRIN...
Wamuu!
I just couldn't hold it back, Master Kars.
...
So be it, Wamuu.
Yes, my master.
I forgive you. Fight with them to your heart's content.
...
As you wish.
Esidisi, you shall fight with him too.
Heh heh heh. Now you're talking.
JoJo and Caesar! I will acknowledge your strength...
Hmph! If you want to fight right now, then I'll take you on!
Let's go, Caesar!
Yeah! We can beat them now!
I, Wamuu, will now consider you to be worthy prey!
You'd better entertain me, you little chickadees!
More, JoJo, more! Is that the limit of your Hamon?!
Shut your mouth! If you really want to feel my Hamon that much, then I'll shower you with it...
Huh? It looks like Wamuu can control wind... And Esidisi can control heat!
Heh heh heh! What's wrong? Try fighting back, why don't you?
I can feel how I've improved since we last fought...
Our Hamon...can reach them!
It was a good fight. I'm satisfied now!
Master Esidisi, you were marvelous...
Wamuu...
I can't believe the both of us together couldn't stop them...
...
Esidisi, Wamuu, that's enough!
You both have a bad habit of enjoying your fights too much...
Sir...
Hmph.
The Red Stone of Aja is moments away. We can't waste any more time here.
Listen up, Hamon users. Next, you shall fight me, Kars.
Now we have to fight YOU?!
Just what I was hoping for!
Let's go, JoJo!! Now we can finish this!
Caesar? Aren't you getting a bit overexcited?
Kars! On my honor as a Zeppeli, I will defeat you!
And what exactly...is a Zeppeli?
Try my special bubbles on for size!
Caesar! You're getting in too close! Draw back a bit!
What's your problem, Caesar? Calm down!
I am calm! Have you gotten scared or something, JoJo?!
Kaaaaars! I'm going to wipe you clean off this earth!
Caesar, what's going on? You don't seem yourself at all...
Is that it? Just as I thought... Esidisi, Wamuu, playtime is over!
Nnnnnggh!
I can't believe you've gotten this strong...
(Oh no...)
(I fought the Pillar Men too, so I know what this means...)
(They still need to learn how to channel their Hamon a little better!)
Nuuu!
!
Lisa Lisa!
I felt something was amiss...
You came to visit us in the middle of the night? How rude...
Hoh! So now all the Hamon warriors are assembled...
...
Kars! Wamuu! Want to play with them one more time?
I see we have no choice. Caesar! JoJo! We need to stop them here!
Yes, master!
(This is bad! The Pillar Men were just testing the waters before. If they get serious...)
(And this turns into a real battle...)
(They'll lose!)
(Oh shit. Lisa Lisa's acting like she's fine, but I don't think she's fully recovered yet.)
(We can't let this battle get out of hand!)
(Hasn't Caesar noticed what's wrong with her?)
Wait! Kars!
Even if you fight here and win,
you still won't be able to get the Red Stone.
What?
(That old man! How does he know about the Red Stone?)
Do you think we're so stupid that we'd actually leave the Red Stone lying around here?
It's hidden away in a special safe.
If we don't send someone to it at every scheduled interval, then a time bomb will blow up the Red Stone!
Enough with the bluffing, you old fool...
It'll only be a small explosion, but more than enough to damage the Red Stone...
Y...
Yeah, yeah, he's right! If we die, then BOOM! BOOM!
Nnnnn...
Lisa Lisa, you still haven't fully recovered from the effects of the anomaly.
In a fight between Hamon users, irregular breathing can be fatal!
...
I'm sorry to dispute what our guest here says, but now is the perfect chance for us to defeat them all!
If we don't beat them now, then when?
Caesar, what's the big rush?
Why are you in such a panic? Calm down and think!
I'm not panicking! This is our chance to finish this!
Ah!
This is our chance to get revenge for our grandfathers, who died because of that Stone Mask!
I'm going to murder every last one of them!
Get revenge? And what the hell do you know about my grandfather, huh?!
Wait, Joseph Joestar. Don't you say another wooord...
This is bullshit. What the hell do people who died 50 years ago have to do with this, you idiot?!
Watch your tongue, JoJo!
You never even met them, and...
SHUDDAP!!!
!
!
Joseph Joestar.
I know you think that you're smarter than other people,
but from where I stand, you're still nothing but a spring chicken.
Say that again, you old geezer!
There is still much about this world you don't know.
If you speak about those things lightly without understanding them properly first, you'll certainly come to regret it!
...
You need to calm down too. No battle can be won through rash action.
This is an issue that concerns my ancestors, the Zeppeli family.
If Kars is here, there's no way that I can let him go without avenging my family.
The feelings you have for your ancestors are very noble ones.
However, you mustn't forget about the people in your family now, and your friends, who feel just the same about you.
If something goes wrong, the survivors will be full of deep regrets. And I think you know exactly how that feels.
...
But it's too late to turn back now.
Hm? That's strange... Are you sure about that?
I thought the promise you made in Rome was to fight in 33 days...
At least, that's what I heard.
Why are you in such a hurry when you've still got another 6 days to spare?
Could it be... Could it be that you're SCARED about how quickly they're growing?
...
...
...
Yeah! Yeah, that's it!
The fight just now proved it to you!
With six more days, Caesar and I...
will get strong enough to completely obliterate all three of you at once!
...
Hmmmm?
Fu... Fu ha ha ha!
So be it. It's a silly taunt, but I'll let you have your way.
For us, six days is no more than the blink of an eye.
Show us how much you can really change in that tiny period.
Esidisi, Wamuu. It's time to go.
Hey, old man. Are you a Hamon user too?
I think I'd like to try you on for size too...
Ha ha ha. You'll get your wish...in six days' time, that is!
(You must be kidding! Hurry up and get out of here! I never want to see your faces again...)
Heh heh heh. I can't wait.
JoJo... Hone your skills! Strengthen yourself!
Until you can no longer resist your urge to kill Wamuu!
Dammit! Those assholes never shut up...
Still, we did manage to get rid of them!
Urrghh...
Are you okay, Lisa Lisa?
Yes...
By the way...who are you?
Me? Hmm, where should I begin...
Well, let's talk about it inside. Jotaro!
This way, Caesar. Oh, and you too, JoJo.
A turtle? What?
Gimme a break...
Hm?
It's resonating... There must be a corpse part somewhere nearby.
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
(Hey... Let me out!)
...
Geez, what's with this thing?
Inside that turtle is a room...filled with people... It makes no sense!
Yeah. I don't know why either. Just grab that corpse part, will you?
Huh? This thing?!
Wh-what's this light?!
Urgh!
You got the Holy Corpse (Ears)!
Got another corpse part...
Gross! It's all dry and flaky!
Hey, take good care of that thing. It's the mummy of some holy saint or something.
What? That's not really ringing any bells...
I know! I just got a great idea!
I'm gonna show it to Caesar and creep him out! Heh heh heh...
So annoying...
America -2011-
Jotaro's daughter, Jolyne Cujoh, has been incarcerated at G.D. St. Prison for a crime that she didn't commit,
thanks to a trap set by Father Pucchi, who is seeking The Way to Heaven.
In order to thwart Pucchi's plans, Jolyne escaped from prison together with her companions.
However, they found Pucchi lying in wait for them at Cape Canaveral,
together with Full Moon, a Stand that can change the direction of gravity...
Those buildings...
Are they upside down? No... Something's not right here...
The ground is slanted!
That...looks like some sort of facility...
Hmm...?
Cape Canaveral's terrain influenced Pucchi and gave him a new Stand!
I knew it could change the direction of gravity,
but I can't believe it can control people as well...
Jolyne, you have to run! We need to get away and regroup!
Now that those two are after us... We won't be able to win like this!
No! I can't run away.
If I run now, Pucchi will get just what he wants!
Hey...
!
!
What's going on here? Why is the gravity so weird?
Are you...Jotaro?!
Oh good! You're safe!
...
S-Something's not...right. You're young...and your clothes...
You two know me?
Oh, gimme a break. This happened once already...
(I don't know how many years in the future this is, but I must still be alive...)
Jolyne! They're here!
Ermes! Anastasia!
...
...
Hm. Looks like they've gotten tangled up in an anomaly.
Hey, woman. These two might have been your friends once, but they're your enemies now.
Pull out your Stand out and get ready!
First, we need to defeat them.
You know something about this?
Jolyne! I'll smash you to pieceeeeees!
I'll dismantle you...
I'll love every little piece of you, Jolyne.
Guess I'll have to go all-out! With Diver Drive as an opponent, I can't afford to take risks!
Ermes! Snap out of it!
Shut the hell uuuuup! You festering pukebaaall!
Gimme a break...... They're both close-range power types?
They're quite the aggressive duo...
My stickers dealt them a world of pain!
Diver Drive... "Dismantling complete"...

Ooogh...
Ggh...
Now then...
(He seems strangely confident!)
(He looks completely different and much younger, but...this is my father!)
(This is Jotaro Kujo!)
Nnnngh... Wh-What did I just do?
Urgh... I... What happened to me?
Y-You're back? Both of you?
Do you recognize me? What about Jolyne?
Why are you asking me that, Emporio?
What the hell is he talking about?
Hm?
Who are you? Why are you standing so close to Jolyne?
This is my father!
...
...
...
What did you just say?
Jolyne! Are you serious?
Have you lost your mind? Are you being affected by some Stand?
That was you, until a few minutes ago!
...No. I know that it seems crazy, but I sense the Joestar blood in him.
This man is Jotaro Kujo, my father!
I've met Jotaro.
And you're right, they definitely look alike.
...
I am Jotaro Kujo... But..."daughter?"
Gimme a break... I guess I'll save my surprise for later, though.
Hey, Gramps.
What is it?
Huh?
I've got another favor to ask.
Don't tell me... You want me to explain again?
Hey! Someone just came out of that turtle!
I'm sick and tired of hearing that line.
Just follow the old man.
What does he think I am, his personal servant? Sheesh... Hey you, come a bit closer, will you?
You too. Get in after them.
!
Oh my god! It can't be true! No way!
?
Weather Forecast!
I thought you died in the battle against Pucchi!
I'm sorry, Jolyne... But you need to die.
Weather...?
You should have never gotten involved in my cursed life...
Oh no... That's the Devil's Rainbow! It's Heavy Weather!
Listen up. It's the same as what happened with those two... He's trying to take you out.
I know. I don't want to believe it, but it certainly seems that way...
We'll just do what we did before.
Okay. In order to bring Weather back to normal... I'll beat him to a pulp!
I want to wreak total chaos...
I curse everything... Myself, and everyone who gets involved with me!
Is that how you really feel?!
As the world falls deeper into chaos, I can feel a sense of satisfaction deep at the bottom of my heart. I can't even stop it myself...
That's not true! You're just under someone else's control, that's all!
Gimme a break... That's one hell of a Stand...
Weather! I'll wake you up!
The Noble One will guide us to heaven... Even the cursed ones like me...
Jolyne... I'll be back...
Back to destroy this whole world...
Weather! Wait!
H-He disappeared! Into that light!
So he got away, huh?
Um, I don't know what to call you...
So I guess I'll just call you dad for now.
What's happening here?
I thought at first this was all Pucchi's doing, but it's not that simple, is it?
To think that we would both travel across time and traverse worlds to encounter each other in a place like this...
Jotaro Kujo...
Pucchi!
I suppose this is the first time we've met...
Although strictly speaking, this is the second time I've met the 'you' from 1988.
Whaaat...
Caaaaaw!
That's...
Squawk! (GRIN)
A...bird? Is that a falcon?
Get them, Animal Shop...
They dare to defy our Heaven, so it's time to show them Hell!
Attack Animal Shop and damage him!
SQUAAAAWK!
Pucchi...was it? What the hell did you just say?
How have we already met before?
You don't need to know. Even if I explained, you still wouldn't understand.
Pucchi! There's no way in hell I'll let you go to heaven!
I can't let you get what you're after here in Cape Canaveral!
Heh heh heh...
Jolyne. That heaven you speak of...
Are you referring to what the me from this world is seeking?
Hmph... I don't need that any more. It's useless now.
What?
The heaven that I was seeking lay elsewhere, you see.
And now, I have found it. No...he...my dear friend found it for me.
I am no longer a martyr who must continue walking down a thorny path.
I am a resident of Heaven, who has discovered the path of truth.
And now, for the sake of my dear friend and Heaven, I shall defeat you both, in body and soul!
Squawk! Squawk!
Enough with the dramatic bullshit.
What he's saying sounds completely different than before...
Let us sing praises for the new Heaven!
Squawk! Squawk!
Whatever adversity we might face, we must never lose our hope.
Hope is a powerful form of courage! It gives us the power to stand up to destiny!
Destiny is what we must conquer in order to achieve human happiness...
And for me and my dear friend, that destiny was the Joestar bloodline!
Pucchi seems like a completely different person...
I'm not hearing your lecture too well... Can you speak up a bit?
Farewell, Kujos...
Squaaaaaaawk!
I have to spread the good news across the world!
The nobility of his reality! The sheer brilliance!
What did you just say?
What did I say? You don't need to know.
You're both...quite strong...
Heh heh heh...
Have you ever seen a night sky full of glittering stars?
All the stars pull toward one another and shine even brighter...
Do you believe in 'gravity?' Do you know that there is gravitational force at work even between human beings?
Pucchi! What are you talking about?!
You probably won't be able to understand...
But we have arrived at the only path that leads to true Heaven.
A path that can guide all the humans in this world to true happiness...
The Eyes of Heaven!
What?!
Let the light from the Holy Corpse guide you, Jotaro Kujo...
When you have collected all the parts, then, and only then, will the gateway open to my dear friend's Heaven!
Squaaaaaaawk!
(That guy just now...)
(It seemed like he wasn't being affected by an anomaly... And more like he's on the side of whoever's causing them...)
Hm?!
It's resonating... There must be a piece of the Holy Corpse close by.
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
I eagerly await the day, Jotaro...
The day when you kneel before his reality!
(Gimme a break... Reality, overwriting... What the hell do any of those words mean?)
...
(Reality...overwriting...)
(Your friends become your enemies, and enemies you thought you'd defeated come back to life...)
(Reality...is being overwritten?)
L-Look!
You got the Holy Corpse (Right Arm)!
We got the corpse part...
Just three more now.
Eww! Dad, what is this?
Gramps will explain everything when you're in the turtle.
One more thing... Cut it out with the dad stuff. You're older than me, dammit...
What should I call you instead, then? "Old man," like I used to before?
I have a lot of questions to ask you later.
Gimme a break.
Nnnnn?!
What...is this?!
(H-Hey, woah! What's going on, Jotaro?)
When I tried to go in the Light Rift... It bounced me back.
What's going on here?
Hmmm...
I can't be sure, but...
I'd guess that there are only certain people who can go through to the next era.
Say what?
The Light Rifts serve as a kind of barrier, and repel people who don't have the right qualifications to go through.
What do you mean by qualifications? How are you supposed to know if you have them or not?
What's that noise? The corpse parts are resonating!
Whose is it? Whose is making a sound?
Huh? It's...mine?!
A-And mine too!
Looks like Mr Joestar and Josuke are allowed to enter the next era.
We have to split up, you mean? Sounds dangerous...
It'll be fine. Following the corpses has gotten us this far, after all...
You just take care, Mr Joestar.
Yes. Thank you, Speedwagon.
Good luck, Josuke.
Just leave this to me! I'll be back before you know it.
So...
What are we supposed to do until they get back?
Hmm. I guess we just have to stay on standby in Morioh Town...
Standby?
...
Huh? Where are you going?
I'm just going to take a look over there.
Dollars are no good in this shop, dear.
Would you like me to convert them into yen?
Really? That'd be great. Umm...what's the service charge?
Oh, you needn't worry about that.
But in return, maybe you'd consider doing me a little favor...
How would you feel about making a little bet with me?
If you win, I'll double your money.
Gambling? I'm pretty good at that, you know...
Or are you trying to con a poor tourist out of her money with some third-rate swindling?
We can make any sort of bet you like. It won't take any time. For example...
I'll flip this coin, and you can guess which side it will land on.
How about that? It's simple, but it's still a bit thrilling, don't you think?
Fine... Okay, heads!
Very well. I will bet on tails, in that case.
Wait...what happens if I lose?
I don't need any money. Instead, I'll take your soul. How about that? Your soul... Heh heh heh.
My s-soul?
(Hang on a minute... Is this guy...serious? Or is he just trying to act cool?)
Well, what do you say?
Sure, whatever...
GOOD! This is getting fun.
By the way... That's a very unusual mark that on your neck.
Hm?
Speaking of stars...
Do you know that bizarre expression that refers to the stars?
Long long ago, when people believed that Heaven was way up in the sky,
everyone thought the stars were holes used to peer down on Earth, and that they shone because of the light that came pouring out of them.
And...oh, what did they call them again? Ah yes...
The Eyes of Heaven...
!!
Oh my...
It's tails...
Hey. You can't just go wandering off by yourself like that. You might run into an anomaly assassin...
Ahh...
You!! You're...Darby!!
Jolyne! Get away from him!
It's too late now...I'm claiming my prize!
You made a bet, remember? You bet me your soul!
Ah!
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
Betting makes it easier to pull people's souls out from their bodies. And my Stand has the power to capture them!
But I suppose I don't need to explain that to you, Jotaro...
Both sides are tails... Talk about a cheap trick.
A cheap trick was all it took. Unlike her father, she was quite a careless young girl...
...
You've got guts, Darby. I'll give you that.
I see you've even got your deck of cards ready.
...
Looks like you want me to beat you at poker once again. Am I right?
...
Jotaro...
I lost to your bluff back then...
I was so humiliated... I'll never forget it! I've never been so ashamed in my entire life...
I just couldn't forgive myself...
I cursed myself for suffering that mental defeat!
I will never revert to the pathetic Darby I once was! Never again!
The Noble One didn't send me here!
No, I have come to fight with you to reclaim my honor as a gambler!
Jotaro! Duel me in poker once more! I'll bet your daughter's soul on it!
Fine...
Say it, then.
...
I'll bet my own soul.
Good!
OK! OPEN THE GAME!
Let's begin!
Urrgh...
Looks like Jolyne's soul is back.
You lose, Darby.
Heh heh... Impressive.
I stole your daughter's soul, and you stole it back. Now we're even.
You've gotta be kidding me. You really think I'm just going to let you leave now?
Of course. That's exactly what I think. You've let countless enemies escape up until now, haven't you?
That's it!
Jotaro. I feel very, very good right now...
I have confirmed that you are just as powerful as you ever were.
So, I will give you just one warning...
If you meet the Noble One, you mustn't fight him!
If you do, all trace of you will be wiped away from this world. Not even your soul will remain.
...
I want to extract your soul and add it to my collection.
That's why I'm warning you...
Farewell, JoJo. I hope we'll meet again.
Mmmnn...
I-I lost... I lost that bet...
Gimme a break...
But... That overwriting reality thing...
I still have no idea what kind of an ability it could be.
Your abilities will never be able to stand up to the Noble One...
Is this that overwriting reality thing again?
Oh?
You know the secret of the Noble One's Stand?
No... I doubt that words alone would allow you to understand the true meaning...
The true meaning of overwriting reality, and ceasing to exist in a world...
America -1890-
Steel Ball Run, the first-ever horseback race across North America, had just begun,
and the wheelchair-bound Johnny Joestar and Steel Ball-wielding Gyro Zeppeli entered the race together.
But President Funny Valentine, the true mastermind behind the race,
planned to use the event to gather the Holy Corpse parts which had been scattered throughout the land.
The duo raced on, fending off assassins hell-bent on retrieving the Holy Corpse, but...
At the 8th stage of the race, Gyro was defeated by the powerful assassins of Valentine, who aimed to take home everything for himself.
Cornered and desperate, Johnny used his fallen friend's Steel Balls and fired a bullet of revival.
Josuke?
I don't see him... Must just be me, then.
Where could this be? It looks like the sea, and yet...
Aaah!
He'll come back...once more.
I'm sure of it...once more...
Valentine...
What...are you doing there?
I don't know who you are, but...stay back!
Don't come near me!
Ah!
Enough already...
That Infinite Spin...
It's useless against me now.
What?
B-But that can't be! I felt it hit you!
I hit you dead on with Complete Golden Spin Energy!
And yet...the Infinite Spin has vanished!
This battle of ours can no longer be won... It's been interrupted.
Still...those nail bullets of yours might be capable of taking him down...
It pains me to do this...but all I can do now is bet on that hope...
Interrupted? "Him?" What are you talking about?
You...
You're Jonathan Joestar...correct?
!
!
Jonathan. If you're here, in this world, in this era...
Then the search for the Holy Corpse parts must be proceeding well.
Keep it up. Find them...
The true battle will begin once you've gathered them all.
He disappeared...
But it seemed like he was so desperate to kill me...
Wait! His horse... It's still alive...
Ungh!
That corpse part that was here...it's gone!
The corpse part disappeared!!
?
Wh...What?
Ah! Slow Dancer's wounds from President Valentine... They're gone!
They've all healed!
Had those wounds been a little deeper, even Hamon wouldn't have been able to heal them... But it's all right now.
By the way...
This wouldn't be the corpse part you're referring to, would it?
That's...
That's it! Give it here, you thief! What've you done with the rest of it?
...
...No.
You've been over here this whole time, now that I think about it...
You didn't even get near the Holy Corpse.
I apologize. I shouldn't have called you a thief...
I'm Johnny. Your name is Jonathan, right? What are you doing here?
Well, you see...
...and then I came here.
The Holy Corpse must have sensed the anomalies in our eras as well, and started appearing in them.
I've traveled through those Light Rifts in order to gather the corpse parts and more allies. That's how I got here.
But I never realized that the Holy Corpse actually comes from this era...
...
That's such a fantastic story, I find it hard to believe.
But I can't deny that you appeared here holding a corpse part. And moreover...
Slow Dancer.
I need the Holy Corpse.
Fine then, Jonathan. I'm coming with you.

Where are we?
I remember this place. We passed through during the race... It's Rocky Mountain Village!
I remember this place. We passed through during the race... It's Rocky Mountain Village!
Is there a corpse part nearby?
W-What's that?!
Shh!
You can't make any loud noises.
Diego's ability...turned all the villagers into dinosaurs.
But I don't believe it... Is this one of those anomalies?
Diego died on the railroad in New Jersey. I saw it with my own eyes.
Did you say...Diego? Diego Brando?
You know him?
We've met before. He was trying to gather the Holy Corpse parts for the anomaly side.
So that's it. He's using the dinosaurs to look for the corpse part!
Shit. We've got to find it before he does!
Right. Let's go.
Make your way to the goal displayed on the stage!
What are you doing here?
Johnny... Jonathan!
Diego!
How can you be alive? I saw you die after Valentine defeated you!
Hmph...
You did well to slip past the dinosaurs and make it this far.
But it's all the same, in the end.
You're still going to be torn apart and scattered all over the grouuuuund!
They're all coming for us all at once!
I'll counterattack with a Hamon barrage!
WRRYYY! Cut through them!
Dinosaurs are the most fearsome monsters the world has ever seen!
Ggh! B-Beasts like these actually existed once!?
Those nail bullets of yours are useless against a pack this size!
Dammit! There are too many of them! They just keep coming!
I know you all used to be humans... Forgive me for hurting you.
Now's hardly the time for that! We've still got Diego to deal with!
Resistance is futile against dinosaurs! MUDAAA!
You actually defeated the dinosaurs? I suppose I could have used just a few more...
!
...
D...Dio!
JoJo...
Seems like the ties of destiny bind us stronger than we ever knew...
And now we meet again, in this wooooorld!
That man... How is he moving like that? He looks different from the dinosaur people!
Listen up. I will be the one to destroy JoJo. Such is my destiny!
You just take care of the man on the horse!!
...
You certainly seem to enjoy waltzing in and tossing out orders...
However, it looks as if our interests are a perfect match...for I want to finish off Johnny!
Johnny! Watch yourself! That man is a vampire!
First dinosaurs, and now vampires? This is getting ridiculous!
Let's put an end to this right here!
A tag team of monsters who've both surpassed humanity... We can't let them get near the corpse part!
You, Johnny Joestar, are my greatest trial!
Hmph! Here I come, JoJooo!
Take this, Diegooo!! You'll have the Holy Corpse over my dead body!
You think you can keep up with a dinosaur's kinetic visioooon?!
I'm going to wring the life out of you!
I'll cleanse the world of your filth!
I can sense limitless evil within those two!
Eat nail bullets, you damn monsters!
May you waste away in this frontier world, JoJooooo!
I'm going to slice your head right off, Johnny Joestar!
Shit! Those nail bullets really are dangerous...
I need to make sure I don't get in too close...
That energy is dangerous... It's something that shouldn't be...
This trial will be "Subjugation and Certain Death!"
JoJoooo...
I, Dio, admit that your spirit has explosive power!!
This Hamon you've acquired is truly potent!!
Which is why...I want to slaughter you even more now!
Ggh! They disappeared again...
Ah!
That man is...
Valentine!
It should be obvious by now, but just in case, I'll say it.
This has nothing to do with my ability!
...
G-Gyro?!
I did not bring back a living Gyro Zeppeli from any of the infinite parallel worlds!
You terrorists, who dare to target the Noble One...
I'm...gonna crush you all beyond all recognition!
B-But how?! How could Gyro be alive?
Listen well, Johnny Joestar! Push your Stand power to its limits!
Fight for your friend with all you've got...and defeat me!
Gyro! How can you fight alongside Valentine?!
We have no choice but to fight, Johnny! Keep your heart strong!
Now, show me the extent of your capabilities...Johnny Joestar...
Here we go, terrorists!
So you can use the Spin too? Where did you learn the secrets of the Zeppeli family?!
Gyro, you taught it to me yourself! You gave me Spin lessons!
More! Show us power even beyond what you hit me with in Philadelphia!
Urrrgh! Shit!
Something's not right here... That Valentine man... He isn't attacking to kill!
Gyro...don't you recognize me?
This won't do... You won't be able to defeat him at this rate!
Eat my Steel Balls...and say goodbye to this world!
Gggh! Damn! Not too shabby!
Gyro...you still don't remember me?
Please, try...
Sing those stupid songs and make those awful jokes, like you used to...
Ahh! Wait! It's coming back to me... I remember now...
You, you're guy who pissed me off so badly...
...that I swore I'd feed my Steel Balls to you the next time I saw you!
G...Gyro...
Johnny Joestar...
If you hit first, and your Stand strikes true...
Perhaps you could defeat...him...
Although, if I had to choose another person...
It'd be that boy Giorno Giovanna, who's been working alongside you.
His power might stand a chance as well...
But only...after the corpse is assembled...
That Valentine man...he wasn't attacking to kill!
It's like he was only testing us...
Ah!
My corpse part is resonating... There must be another part somewhere nearby!
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
!
You got the Holy Corpse (Legs)!
Just...one part?
I've lost everything. My friends, my corpse parts...
Johnny...
I know how you must feel. I lost much as well...
But for now, we've got to focus on regathering the corpse parts and stopping the anomalies.
I have a feeling that's how we'll save your friend, as well.
...
Morioh Town, Momoji District, S City, Japan -Present Day-
Near the Wall Eyes, the protuberances that suddenly appeared in town,
a strange young man with a star-shaped birthmark on his shoulder was discovered in the ground.
All his memories were lost to him, including his own name.
He was given the name Josuke Higashikata, and was allowed to live in the home of his new guardians until he could find the truth about his origins.
This is a story about dispelling a curse - for curses must be dispelled.
Is this...
Somebody's garden?
I thought we were gonna get flung somewhere crazy, but it's just a plain old Japanese house!
Wait. Mr Joestar?
He isn't here. Did he go somewhere else?
Woah...
Dammit, Josuke!
Don't get cocky now and act like you're smarter than me!
If you even think that you 'beat me,' I'll kill you!
...
I don't even know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about Shakedown Road!
Look, I'm not sure what happened back there, but you discovered some way to get out of that mess, didn't you?!
You used some dirty trick, didn't you?
And now look at you, all cool and collected! Man it pisses me off!
?
Hey, Joshu. What is that?
Don't change the subject!
Just look over there! It's coming at us!
Wh...
Wh-what...is that?
Joshu!
Eeeek! H-Help me!
Gyaaaaaah!
What is this? What's going on?
Aw crap!
Who're you? Are you the one behind this?
Soft & Wet!!
You're a Stand User? Wait, I'm not your enemy!
I just came here looking for parts of the Holy Corpse...
...But I guess that makes no sense to you. Hmmm, how should I put it?
What? The Holy Corpse?!
It did make sense to you?!
All I know about the corpse is what some old man on Shakedown Road told me...
You...
piss me ooooff!
Joshu?
Just strolling on into someone's house like you own the place?
I'm gonna beat you to death!
So...he really is a Stand User!
This is just like with Okuyasu and Shigechi!
All along I thought I understood what was going on, even though I didn't really get it at all...
But maybe that's what's causing the anomalies!
Well, the details can wait. First we need to quiet that guy down!
What's his ability?
Don't know. This is the first time I've seen it too...
Now listen up! Yasuho is miiiiiine!!
She's my woman! I'll never let you have herrrr!
What does she even have to do with this!?
Yasuho even lets me give her kisses! Deep, hoooot ones!
...How can you say something so stupid with such a straight face?
This guy's giving me bad vibes... My instincts are telling me to steer clear from him.
Joshu... So this is your ability...
RERORERORERORERO!

Bleugh...
Okay, now he's all ours. I can only mimic what I saw, but I think if I use the corpse part...
Urgggh...
I-I... Huh?
Back to normal now, Joshu?
Hm?
What are you glaring at me for, huh!? You want me to beat the crap outta you!?
DORAA!
Gyaaahh!!
Hey! What're you doing?!
Huh? He looked like he wasn't recovered yet, so I just hit him again...
...
Fair enough.
Should we shine the light on him one more time?
That's the Holy Corpse...
Tell me what you know about this.
...And that's how it is.
...
I don't think anyone would believe that... It sounds like pure insanity.
But this Holy Corpse may be an important clue to help me learn about myself.
Okay. I'll go with you.
I'll be counting on you.
Hmm?
Do you...have other family members?
Yeah. None of them are home, though, aside from me and Joshu. Why?
Nah... It just felt like someone was hiding over there.
LOOK OVER HEEERE!
Wh-What is that? Something's coming...
...
What? YOU?!
Watch out! That's an explosive Stand! If he touches you, he'll blow up!
Explosive? He's charging right for us!
Go...Heart Attack!
Attack Yoshikage Kira and damage him!
Gggh!!
LOOK OVER HEEERE!
Shining Diamond! Heal him!
Hoo...
I couldn't believe it at first, but you're actually capable of forcing my Heart Attack back...
Josuke Higashikata. To think I'd run into you again in this world...
Imagine the depths of my misery...
Give it a rest! What are you even doing here?!
Yoshikage Kira!
What?!
Indeed... I feel the hand of destiny at work here.
Wha- Who-
Are there...two Yoshikage Kiras?
Two? What are you saying?
I thought this world's Morioh would be a decent place to live, like ours, but...
Of all things, you had to show up...
I don't know if an anomaly is causing this or what...
But why the hell did you both have to come back to life, goddammit?!
Answer me! Which one is Yoshikage Kira?
Both!
We're going to blow you away until there's no trace of you left...
With our bombs...
His ability! It explodes whenever it touches something!
Hoo... Interested in my Stand? Here, I'll give it all to you...
Get ready to be blown to bits!
Two Deadly Queens?! As if he wasn't dangerous enough already!!
They're both Kira? What the hell?
Hold up, hold up, hold up. I don't get it either. I need to get my thoughts in order...
Yes! Josuke Higashikata, blown to pieces!
Tonight...I'm going to sleep better than I have in a long time...
Shining Diamond...
I don't think I'll ever start liking your ability.
But I'm still going to blow you away in the end... Both of you!
Hold it right there! Are you two looking for the parts of the Holy Corpse, too?
Hmph. Who cares about a corpse?
Huh? Then what are you even doing in this era?!
All the two of us want is a nice, tranquil life. Nothing more.
Yeah right. You murder people for fun!
Wait!
You...are you really both Yoshikage Kira?
That we are...
But not the Yoshikage Kira you were hoping for.
What?
Urggh...
H-Hey, Josukeee!
What happened? I can't remember anything. It's all blank...
I'm not so sure either. You all right? You look pale.
Wait... What... What did I do?
Oh?
Yeah, we finally got some resonance! Must be a part of the Holy Corpse nearby!
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
You got the Holy Corpse (Heart)!
My friends have some of the other Holy Corpse parts, too.
Come to think of it, they might have found all of them by now.
What's this? Wait... What?
Okay then, take me back to your world with you.
What?
What do you mean? Where are you two going?
Don't tell me...you're going to find Yasuho?!
I'm coming too! Take me with you!
Y-You're coming too?
Of couuuurse! I'm not gonna let you get a head start on me!
Yoshikage Kira... The Holy Corpse...
I might be able to find a clue to who I am!
Mr Joestar... Josuke...
They're behind schedule. Wonder if something's keeping them...
...
Aha!
We just got back!
Mr Joestar!
And, er...
I'm Johnny. This here's Slow Dancer.
We're back!
Josuke!
Brought back a nice Holy Corpse part, plus some new allies!
Oh, warmest welcomes.
This place...reminds me of our town, somehow...
Hey! Where's Yasuhoooo?
No idea. You're the one who mentioned her.
Whaaat?
Aaaall right! Now then, let me check out the corpse!
Mr. Joestar, you've got the eyes;
Joseph has the ears;
Jotaro has the body;
Josuke's got the left arm;
Giorno has the head;
Jolyne has the right arm...
What about you, Johnny, and Hat Josuke?
I've got the legs.
Me? The heart.
Then we've gathered eight parts of the Holy Corpse so far.
But what of the last part?
Odd. Why isn't the corpse's light leading us to it?
Speedwagon? I just had a thought.
Remember when the anomaly was affecting Bucciarati and Fugo, and they ran away?
They vanished in the Holy Corpse's light, too.
Could that have something to do with the last corpse part?
Hya hya hya hya!
All the Joestars are together now, I see!
You did a fine job gathering up the corpse all by yourselves!
Unfortunately, none of you will ever see all the parts...
Because the core of the body...the most critical part!
The spine...has already been claimed by the Noble One!
What did you say!?
You are all destined to die here and lose the corpse...
But! The Noble One won't even have to lift a finger.
Ke-KYAAAH!
My Justice...shall dispatch you all in one fell swoop!
Justice wants to dance!
Two, three, aaaand here we go! Moo-kee-kee-kee-kee!
Go on, keep wasting your strength! Your attacks feel lighter than mosquito bites!
Prepare to be crushed! You measly aaaants!
Justice is with me!

Nggggh!
Damn you, Joestars...you and your miserable defiance...
But my work here is already done!
I know now, beyond all doubt,
that the Joestars...have gathered EIGHT of the Holy Corpse paaaaarts!
What a weird old woman.
Who was she calling out to?
!
Whoaaaa! E-Earthquake?
No, this isn't a quake... I know what this is...
Th-this feeling!
I-I don't know what's happening here, but I just broke out in a cold sweat!
This pressure...it feels like it's digging into my soul...
This pitch black sensation!
Whaaat...is thiiiis?!
This aura...
It can't be...
Ah!
The Holy Corpse repels all evil.
However, at the same time!
It also seeks its other parts.
The parts you wield...
They reacted to the spine I possess, and drew you into this main world...
Gimme a break...
I didn't want to believe it, but there's no doubting what I'm seeing right now...
DIO!!
Hmph.
(If I defeat him, Gyro will come back...)
Here we go!
Tusk Act 4!
So that's the energy that put Valentine in checkmate...
MUDAAA!
Wha...
Golden Wind Requiem!
MUDA!!
You'll never reach reality!
Hmm...
Huh?!
Star Platinum!!
ORAAA!
Heh heh heh.
What?!
Gah ha ha ha ha hah!
Such weakness!
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!
Urgh!
Waaaah!
Gwwaaaaaah!!
Waaah! Jotaro! Everybody! They've all been beaten!
What...What happened?
Why didn't Requiem work?!
He just took a direct hit from Tusk Act 4! Why didn't anything happen?!
I know that I felt Star Platinum smash his skull in...
This power is something completely different from vampiric regeneration or The World's ability to stop time...
I was told that the Joestars had defeated me here in this main world...
But if those Stands are all you've got, I fail to see how!
Th...This is...
The corpse parts gravitate toward one another!
The parts you've gathered pulled the spine to you along with I, DIO!
And now, it's the spine's turn to pull all your corpse parts toward me!
Fu ha ha ha ha!! This feels fantastic, Joestaaaaaars!!
Bow down before my reality!
This is bad! We can't let that mist touch us!
Nnn?
What...
I'm one part short...
Huh?!
Tch!
Of course... Jotaro Kujo...
It seems I must defeat him in this world as well...
Enyaba!
Summon my pawns!
The corpse parts gravitate toward one another...
Give them the Holy Corpse parts and have them chase after Jotaro and the others.
As you command.
The corpse part Jotaro holds must be the Joestars' last hope...
I'll rip that hope from them and plunge them into the depths of despair...
Then at last, I'll erase them from this main world!
With my Stand: The World Over Heaven...
It's...It's Air Supplena Island!
Did Jotaro's Holy Corpse part pull us here to safety?
That was close... If that mist had gotten to us, we would have been in serious trouble!
Damn, so that asshole was the guy behind the anomalies?
That was...DIO!
We lost nearly all the corpse parts.
Damn it!
Our attacks didn't even faze him! Why!?
Requiem has the power to prevent any reality from happening.
When my Stand's fist hit his Stand, I'm sure that Requiem activated. And yet...
My attack was negated, as if I never had such an ability in the first place!
...
Valentine!
I've no need for you now.
The one I'm here for is...
You, Jotaro Kujo.
You're going to fight me, here and now.
Show me what your ability can do!
...
Hmm...
I don't know what you're planning, but you asked for it.
Whoever you are, you've got one hell of an attitude.
Star Platinum... Precise movements, superb energy, and even the ability to stop time...
A speed so terrific it surpasses light and stops time itself...
Not only is it the most powerful Stand the world's ever seen, it's practically invincible...
But what I want to see is beyond even that.
Show me what your Stand has been hiding!
At this rate, you'll accomplish nothing. Have we...no hope at all?

I...knew it...
Your Star Platinum is the same type as DIO's Stand!
That's why your corpse part wasn't stolen!!
?
There's no time, so I'll be brief.
At first, my only goal was to gather all the parts of the Holy Corpse.
That, and nothing more.
However, when that Johnny Joestar over there fired his Infinite Spin at me...
I began to fly through parallel worlds, looking for a way to escape from it.
I can visit parallel worlds that are similar to this main one,
thanks to the power of my Stand.
Even I can't be sure how many parallel worlds there are, but they all exist aside one another.
Then, I met him.
A DIO from a parallel world?
Indeed. The main world version of you defeated DIO in the 1988 battle,
but there are parallel worlds where that never occurred.
In that particular world, he turned the tables on the Joestars and conquered the world as he'd planned,
using his Stand power, which had evolved to its final stage.
...
He caught me. There was no escape.
His Stand's power is incredibly powerful, terrifying...and infinite.
Johnny's Infinite Spin wouldn't leave my body no matter what I did,
yet he made it disappear with a wave of his hand.
Urk...
When DIO discovered that the world he'd conquered was only one of many parallel worlds,
he set his sights on the main world and began his invasion.
...
So what do you want me to do about it?
I want you to defeat him.
I'm pretending to be under his control and aiding his invasion as I search for someone with the power to take him down.
That someone is you, Jotaro.
DIO's Stand...
The World Over Heaven - What kind of ability does it have? How many secrets does it hide?
I don't know. I couldn't find any clues, unfortunately...
However, yours is the only part of the Holy Corpse that he couldn't steal. There's no way that was by chance.
We can't trust this guy!
He's obviously got some ulterior motive!
Everything I've been telling you is true.
I am not acting for my own personal gain.
I don't want the Holy Corpse for power, or to control anyone.
Everything I do is for the prosperity of my country and its people!
However, DIO's aims transcend nations. He's gunning to conquer the world itself...
He must be stopped at all costs!
Someone needs to learn the secrets of his ability and defeat him.
You, Jotaro Kujo...are the only one who can do that.
I suspect DIO will distribute the corpse parts to his underlings and have them search for yours.
Defeating his minions and reclaiming the Holy Corpse parts should bring us closer to defeating DIO himself.
...
There's one more thing I must tell you.
I heard the DIO from this main world has already been defeated.
Are his remains still here?
Huh? What are you talking about?
If two of the same thing from different worlds come in contact with each other, they will cancel each other out and disappear.
DIO doesn't know this.
Hey, hang on. That doesn't make sense.
I'm standing right here with an old grandpa version of myself from 50 years in the future, but we haven't disappeared.
You two may be from different eras, but you're both the same world's Joseph Joestar.
Therefore, you will not disappear.
DIO, however, is different. He comes from an parallel world. If we could bring him in contact with the corpse of this world's DIO...
If luck is on our side, we could erase him before he even has a chance to use his powers.
Once the sun touched DIO's body, it turned to dust.
There's nothing left of him.
I see... Unfortunate, but so be it.
Then I have nothing more to say.
Whether or not you believe me is up to you.
I only ask that you choose what is right!
I may be late with this, but that was a weird conversation.
Valentine is not to be trusted...
Trust him or not, we've got to get the corpse parts back.
Jonathan's right!
We have to start all over? This is gonna take forever...
No. We'll get it done much quicker this time,
since our enemies will be lying in wait for us wherever we go.
We're going to take Valentine's advice, then?
Looks like it. Right, Dad?
So the plan's to recover the Holy Corpse parts that DIO stole,
free our allies from his control,
then find out his Stand's secret and defeat him?
Gimme a break.
I might actually break a sweat this time...
DIO's ability is the real problem here.
We have no idea how it works! If we can't figure that out, we'll just get swatted down again.
Johnny...
When you fought DIO, it looked like his fists repelled your attacks. Does that sound right to you?
Yeah...well, no, not quite.
I wouldn't say he repelled my attacks, so much as negated them.
Even my surefire, one-hit-kill nail bullets disappeared!
...
Something wrong?
I have a feeling DIO's power and my Golden Wind Requiem may have something in common...
My Requiem has the power to negate an opponent's will and actions, and prevent them from reaching reality.
However, his power is the reverse of that.
Perhaps it allows him to turn whatever he wishes into reality.
Whaaat?
In our battle, he overwrote reality and made our attacks ineffective.
Bloody hell! That's absurd!
If that's really the case, how could anyone beat him?
We can't allow him to stay in this world! We've got to find his weak point, no matter what...
I'm going to fight!
When my fist met his Stand, I felt pure evil.
He must be stopped!
All I want is to collect the corpse parts so that I can bring Gyro back.
If he's going to try to get in my way, then I'll make sure that the next time we meet...he dies instantly!
Tch! We've already got our hands full with the Pillar Men...
What a pain in the ass. It's gonna be such a relief to crush this guy!
All that talk about worlds makes this whole thing feel so big it's almost unreal.
But at this rate, Morioh Town will be in danger too. Count me in!
I just want to know who I really am...
But it looks like we're not going anywhere until we defeat him.
DIO was the one who influenced Father Pucchi... That alone tells me how dangerous he is.
We've got to seal that power of his away.
Stop it! Don't listen to a word he says!
...
I completely understand why you'd be so cautious.
I can also understand why you're concealing that gun you plan to shoot me with...
You're damn right I am... This is the gun you used to shoot Gyro,
and now it's going to do the same to you!
Ahh!
No way!
Whoaaaaa!
!
Is someone with a corpse part here?
I see...
Him, huh?
This guy is really annoying, but I guess we've got no choice...
Oh, my. It seems that since we last met...
The Noble One... Lord DIO gave you a nasty thrashing.
...
I'm not here to make small talk. Listen up.
Let's have ourselves a gamble. The stakes are...our Holy Corpse parts.
Oh, really now?
Well, you've certainly got my attention. But what makes you think I'll play along?
I'll throw in my soul.
What?
Course, you'll need to put something up in return.
If you lose...you'll tell me the secret of DIO's Stand.
!
Pfft. No falling off your chair this time?
Please, Jotaro, do you think I'm that easy to provoke?
I happen to know of a person far more knowledgeable about Lord DIO's power than I.
If I lose, I'll tell you their name. How's that?
That'll do.
Now, let me hear you name your stakes, one more time.
I bet my soul, and my part of the Holy Corpse.
Good!
OK! OPEN THE GAME!
Let's begin!
You lose, Darby.
...
Let me ask you one thing, Jotaro.
Why didn't you stop time?
I was in fine form today.
I know I would have sensed if any Stand powers were interfering.
Were you holding me in contempt?
...
I didn't think I could beat you by simply stopping time.
I had a feeling you'd have a trap lying in wait if I did.
So I didn't do it. Simple as that.
You really are a detestable man...
Take it and go!
You got the Holy Corpse (Left Arm)!
Father Pucchi...
!
He's the one who knows about Lord DIO's ability.
One might even call him an aide. He supports all of Lord DIO's efforts.
He's also deeply connected to your future...
If it were me, I'd want to ask Father Pucchi some questions before I challenged Lord DIO again.
Though Pucchi possesses a rather troublesome Stand power himself.
You really are spilling the beans now, huh?
Well, I am a gambler. I don't much care for that priest and his miracle-peddling.
Plus, I wouldn't want Lord DIO to erase your soul.
I've prepared a special place for it in my collection, after all.
...
I'm going to be here for a while. If you find yourself in a gambling mood, stop by again.
Oh, wait. One more thing.
Lord DIO's power and my Osiris have one thing in common.
They both have a connection to the soul.
!
While I just collect souls for the sheer pleasure of it...
Lord DIO needs them to fully manifest his power.
(...Souls?)
(Just like in his notebook that I burned up in Cairo.)
(Does this have something to do with what was written in it?)
What's that supposed to mean?
Good question. All I know for sure is how my Osiris works.
You've got all the information I have to give now.
Like I said, if you want to know more about Lord DIO's ability, then you should seek out Father Pucchi.
At laaaaaast! I've found you, Jotaro Kujo!
Now, to enlist your corpse part in the name of my armyyyyy!
If you don't wanna get hurt,
then hand the damn corpse parts over now!
One wrong move and I'll shoot! No wrong moves and I'll shoot anywaaaaay!
For now, we'll leave you only half dead!
Stop, villains! I, Stroheim and the military are here to stop you once and for all!!
Watch closely! Peel your eeeyes! And sear our proud and gallant figures into your retinaaaaaas!
Come a little closer! Don't you run from me!
I'm gonna wipe you you clean outta this world!
And thus, Jotaro Kujo's corpse part has been claimed by my army!
You...You son of a bitch! Are you planning on hogging all the glory?
Urrgh... Where...
Okuyasuuu! You're fiiinally back to normal!
Unngh... What...
Rise and shine, Stroheim!
J-JoJo?
Gimme a break...
Ngh!
Found ya, terrorist scum!
Hmm... Looks like we'll need to take on these evildoers now.
Prepare yourself, scoundrels!
Now! I'm going to crush you! Beyond all recognition!
What's the matter, out of breath already?
You really think that's enough to defeat me?!
Time for me to put an end to all this!
With...this Infinite Spin energy!
Feast on my Hamooon!
This is what it means to be beaten beyond all recognition. Nyo ho ho!
Ungh... J-JoJo?
Mr Zeppeli!
Uuurgh... Is this Rocky Mountain Village?
Hey, Johnny? The hell's going on?
What're we doing all the way back here?
G-Gyro! You remember me?
You got the Holy Corpse (Heart)!
...And that bring us here.
Hmmm. What a strange twist of fate...
In that case, JoJo, we'll be coming with you!
Thank you very much. Now we're bound to win!
This place...
This is the overpass where I defeated DIO...
?
What...
DIO's armlet...
What did Valentine say again?
If two of the same thing from different worlds meet, they'll negate each other...
Maybe I can use this...
You got DIO's Armlet!
I've found you at last...Jotaro Kujo!
I think I'll help myself to that corpse part of yours.
I hope you're prepared...to be split into pieces by my zippers!
My zippers can split anything apart.
Be it your arm, or even your neck...
Hand over the corpse part, now!
I could even play soccer with your head if I wanted to!
Mission accomplished...
Oof...
Wha-what happened? Am I...?
Bucciarati!
We did it!
Glad to see you're finally back to normal!
Bucciarati...
You got the Holy Corpse (Ears)!
...And that should bring you up to speed.
...
Well, if I'm still here...
That must mean there's still something left for me to do.
Giorno. Will you let me help out?
Bucciarati...
Is this...a prison?
Hm?
That woman...wasn't she Koichi's...
I've found you,
dear...
Why are you dragging my cute little Koichi around?
I'm going to hang you up now, so get ready!
(Jotaro! That voice...)
Whoa! What is this, a prison?!
It appears to be an American prison.
This is a golden opportunity. I ought to take some reference photos.
Yukako!
Little Koichi, how I've missed you...
I'll hang you the highest of all!
Hey, Koichi...
It's all right. I'll do the fighting.
I've got to save Yukako!
Do you love me, Koichi?
Yukako...
If you really love me, then die for me!
Her mind is too strong! She's a monster!
Your sounds won't work on me!
The power of her mind is overwhelming! I can't believe her hair stretches this far, either!
I'm begging you, Yukako...turn back to normal!
Do you see now? Love is invincible.
K-Koichi?
Yukako! You're back to normal!
What a relief. You had me so worried!
Hm?
W-Worried? You, Koichi?
You were worried...about me?
Hm?!
Who's there? Show yourself!
Hoo. Oh dear.
I can't believe this. You again?
Why won't you just leave us alone already?
You! Yoshikage Kira!
That DIO guy forced us into giving him our corpse arm.
Not that I understand why you'd be crazy enough to fight for something so ugly and shriveled in the first place.
We planned to hide until you left. And yet, here we are...
We don't like fighting... But now that we've run into you, I suppose we have no choice.
Time for us to get a little payback!
I heard about this, but damn... There really are two of that douchebag now?!
Payback? You must be dreaming.
You're the ones who are gonna get beaten to a pulp!
Bring it on! I'll swipe away your bombs and whatever else you throw at us!
We're going to settle this here and now, you two.
You pursued us here, and for that, you will get no mercy!
We'll exterminate you right here!
I can't believe it...my air bullets don't work on them?!
We've got you all figured out! Fire as many as you want, I'll shave them all away!
We'll blow you away before you can heal yourself!
Go ahead, blow me away! I'll still heal myself!
Yeah! Did you forget?!
Yeah! We're your worst nightmare!
How refreshing...
It certainly feels refreshing, doesn't it?
Urggh...
Ggh...
...
Just to make things clear,
we weren't trying to escape from you.
We could have killed you at any time, had we really wanted to...
The only reason we didn't is simply because we dislike fighting...
But those who threaten our tranquility must be stopped!
Next time... We'll be the ones to attack and erase you for good!
All of you! That's right, even the ones in the turtle! We're not going to leave a single one of you intact!
Talk all you want, you murderous scum!
You got the Holy Corpse (Right Arm)!
...And there you have it.
It's all okay by me, Koichi.
I'm going with you. I'm happy just being by your side.
I won't let DIO or anyone else tear us apart!
Yukako!
Gimme a break...
DIO...
It seems that Jotaro and his allies have already stolen half
of the <color red>Holy Corpse</color> parts that you gave to your pawns.
Not to mention, some of them have also betrayed us.
I see...
So be it.
The corpse parts affect their keepers and amplify their minds...
Along with the power of their souls.
In the end, the Holy Corpse is nothing more than a tool.
What matters is retrieving the souls of the 36 Ultimate Sinners.
The sinners who dare to oppose Heaven will be roused up by the Joestars,
and eventually make their way to DIO!
Then, when I've absorbed those 36 Sinners' souls...
I know without a doubt that I will be able to completely conquer this main world!
...
I have one more matter to report.
It seems that "he" is among the Sinners.
Hmph.
What should we do? Shall I finish him off?
No. I'll go.
DIO...
Should their souls prove unworthy as offerings to you,
would it be all right for me to handle the cleanup myself?
Of course, Pucchi.
Please, deliver our souls from
those who dare to stand in the way of Heaven.
Hee hee! We found you!
It's gig time, baby! YEAH!
Harvest! Steal the corpse part from him!
Let me show you a REAL knockouuuut!
And then...if he fights back...
Kill him!!
It's time for MAX POWER! No holding back!
I'm gonna burn you all to a crisp!
We done did it! It's my corpse part! I got it back!
I finally expressed...my heart! And the scream of my soul!

Uuuuhh...
Wha-what was I doing?
Whoa! Josuke?! And Okuyasu!
Whoa my ass!
Damn it, Shigechi! You know how much trouble you caused us?!
Uurgh... Ummm...
Wakey-wakey, Akiraaaa!
O-Okuyasu?!
Time for you to lend a helping hand too!
Hiiieeeeeee!
Hm?!
Weather Forecast...
Weather Forecast manipulates weather.
The souls of dead criminals will return in the form of frogs, in search of fellow travelers along the road to the netherworld.
I've come...for your souls...
Avoid the frogs and attack Weather Forecast!
If you just would have let the frogs take you...
You could have spared yourself some suffering...
There's no stopping my ability now!
Not until it's reduced this whole world to rubble!
Even I can't stop my ability. It's coming from the deepest recesses of my heart.
Either I kill you!
Or you kill me...
Let this all end...
Scatter the despair in my heart throughout this world as well...
All I have left to hope for is that I might reach Heaven...
Ugh...
I-I... What...
Jolyne?
So you are the Weather I know...
You're too close...Weather.
But I guess...I can put up with it for now...
Only for now...
You've found the Holy Corpse (Head)!
...Did all that make sense?
...
If Pucchi is scheming something, then...
I suppose I'll need to survive a bit longer.
Let me come and help you, Jolyne.
Of course, Weather!
Guh...
I've been running through dozens of parallel worlds...
How many dimensions must I traverse?!
Ahh!!
Something wrong, Valentine?
DIO!!
Is something chasing you? You look so terrified... Heh heh.
(panting)
His Stand's too powerful...
I can't beat him!
Not even if I had the entire Holy Corpse!
I can't defeat this man!
By the way...you still haven't answered my question from before.
What did you tell Jotaro?
I asked you this question some time ago, Valentine.
What are you hoping to accomplish through them?
Don't tell me...you're conceited enough to believe that you could actually defeat I, DIO?!
(panting)
Hey, Valentine...
Have you ever wondered what it is humans live for?
Humans live to overcome their fears and worries, so they can live in peace.
I can give you the reality you long for.
The reality that will finally bring peace to the depths of your heart...
It'd be such a shame to kill a superior Stand user like you.
That's why I never overwrote you completely.
Now, how about abandoning your worthless ambitions and serving me for eternity?
...
There is not a speck of hesitation in my heart or my actions!
All that I do, I do for justice!
Hmph! Then you leave me no choice.
You'll just have to die now, Valentine!
D4C!
This is...
The World Over Heaven.
I, DIO, can arrive at any reality I wish!
Funny Valentine...
You no longer exist...
anywhere.
Is there a Holy Corpse part here?
?
What the hell? When did...
(I don't believe it! Jotaro!)
Just now... Time jumped!
Now we're in the boss'...
No, Diavolo's range!
He's here! I can feel him...
He's right next to us!
I meant for you to see...
When I used Emperor Crimson.
Urgh!
B-Boss!
We're getting closer! We're too close!
An anomaly must have allowed him to escape from the effects of Requiem's power...
If I'd wanted to take you by surprise, I could have mown down a number of you just now.
You are all still standing because I chose not to do so.
...
You've stolen my land, my money, and everything else I own...
But I don't care.
Giorno Giovanna, I will defeat you in order to keep moving forward!
That is the only reason I've come here!
Now watch as I defeat you, and ascend the true emperor's throne!
Futile is futile, no matter how many times you try.
I will reclaim that which you have stolen - the pride of an emperor!
What pride did you ever have, Boss?
I, Diavolo, have always been an emperor who rose to power through strife!
Your "pride" only exists on the surface. Don't you realize that?
It's pointless, no matter how many times you try. And I hate doing pointless things. MUDA MUDA...
Victory! I, Diavolo, am the true emperor!
Urgggh...
Yes! The boss is no match for Giorno!
He totally beat him!
Urk...
My body is aching from the intensity of your power...
However... Heh heh heh. Now I've found it...
Your weak point!
What?
You can have this corpse part. Consider it a farewell gift.
But the next time we meet...
I'll have you singing your own requiem!
...
You got the Holy Corpse (Legs)!
Puny humans! Prepare yourselves!
Resistance is futile! We'll finish this in one fell swoop!
You all came here to die like dogs!
I'm going to cut your flesh into pieces, then line all your organs up on the ground!
I'll cut you open and scoop everything out!!
I'll butcher you right where you stand! WRYYYYYYYYYYYY!
Whaaaat? Why do you look so tense? You still want to keep fighting!?
MUDA MUDA MUDA!! I'll drink you dry!
The corpse belongs with I, Dio!
I'm going to use the power of the corpse to rise to the top!
Impossible! How could I, Dio...
be defeated...by mere humans?!
How dare you...
How could you do this to me?!
I'll remember this! You'll get what's coming to you!
Miserable humans! Next time, I'll drain your veins until not a drop of blood is left!
Tch... Again?
Ugh!
Avdol! Iggy!
(What's this?! Jotaro?)
Finally...we found you!
Avdol, Iggy...
We're gonna bring you back to normal in no time.
Hmph. It doesn't matter how many people you gather!
I'll burn you all until there's nothing left!
Grrrr!
My hellfire will immolate you!
Gwararararf!
Woof! Woof!
It doesn't matter where you hide! My fire will smoke you out!
Heh heh heh. It hurts to go up in flames, doesn't it?
Grrr! Grrr!
There won't even be a trace of you left. You will burn to ash and vanish from the world!
Awoooooooooooo!
Urrghh...
Rrf...
Hmm?
I could have sworn that I just charged into DIO's mansion...
Mr Joestar... What's going on here?
Avdol! You recognize us!
Avdol...
Avdol!
We'll explain what's happening later.
In the meantime...
Thank goodness you're back to normal!
???
Looks like you're finally back to normal too, huh, Iggy?
You little show-off! Heh heh heh.
Grrrr!!
Waaaaaah!
Gyaaaaaaah!
Gimme a break.
!
There you are, Father Pucchi.
I've got something to ask you.
Hm... DIO's power?
Even if you know the secret of my dear friend's power, there's nothing you can do.
You are fools to defy DIO...
Prepare to receive the judgment of Heaven, here and now!
Ngh!?
His power extends even to zombies...
Go forth, zombies!
Punish the fools who dare oppose my dear friend!
Anyone can reach Heaven if they follow him.
Even if they're undead.
For those who would sneer at Heaven...this is a suitable fate.
!
Gimme a break. Looks like these guys weren't pious enough.
...
So. You up next?
Do you not feel this strange destiny at work?
Right now, we're in a fateful place.
All of this began right here, at the Joestar house.
Right here, my dear friend first encountered his destiny, and took his first steps on a path that would lead him to unimaginable heights.
A path toward the salvation of the human race...
Just as ships once used starlight to guide their voyages in the sea,
those who meet him and follow his path...
will journey toward his Heaven!
People meet through gravity. We meet those whom we are destined to meet!
That itself is reality!
Those who attain reality will be blessed!
In Him, mankind will find salvation!
This is what I've longed for!
The Eyes of Heaven!
...Pfft.
...
This, too, must be some strange kind of destiny...
So fitting that I would finish you off in this fateful place.
I guess you don't feel like telling me about DIO's power, huh?
Well, if that's the case, then sorry...
But now I'm going to ask you with my fists!
Lay down your burdens. Entrust everything to DIO...
In the name of my dear friend, DIO! In the name of attaining Heaven!
I will lay you all to rest!
I'll strike you down with every ounce of strength in my body!
I will put an end to this, here and now!
Even now?! Can you still not fathom the sublime wonder of the Eyes of Heaven?
Ooogh...
All right, spit it out. Tell me about DIO's ability!
Fool...
To think that the dwellers of such a fragile straw house could even set foot in our fortress and threaten our profound goals..
And yet, I feel...strangely relieved.
For now...I am convinced of my dear friend's victory.
You see, it is all as he foretold.
Here you are, 36 souls,
all ready to be sacrificed to DIO!
What?
Heh heh heh...
I can't let you catch me.
Joseph's Stand, Hermit Purple, is telepathic, after all...
Just as our planet has a fixed 7-to-3 ratio of ocean to land,
there is also a fixed number of living souls...
Only a certain number of souls can coexist.
...
DIO...
I love you as I love God Himself!
!
36 souls?
...
You got the Holy Corpse (Eyes)!
But if you consider the idea that one man can possess more than one soul...
What do you think he would see?
What do you think his future would bring?
I wanted to go with him...
To see what he would create...with the world...
Did you say "sacrificed"?
Hm?
That's...
DIO!
If you're here,
then you must have defeated Pucchi...
My congratulations, Joestars.
You've done well to reclaim your allies and the corpse.
And now once again, you stand before I, DIO!
DIO...
Bastard...
Tch! Just listen to all that damn bravado!
You're all alone now!
...
Hmph.
I already took care of Valentine...
What?
I don't know what he was trying to tempt you into doing, but it matters little now.
Now then, Joestars.
In the world I come from, you've already been exterminated.
Your deaths will serve as a tribute to my dear friend Pucchi.
...
Come. I'll play with you for a while.
Fight me, Jotaro.
...
I still have no grasp on DIO's ability...
But that asshole's not taking this seriously. This might be our chance...
His Stand is a lot like the DIO we fought before...
Power, plus precise movements... It's the same type as Star Platinum!
Gimme a break. So good so far, but here's where the real problem starts...
Kneel before my reality!

How do you like that?! Jotaro's Star Platinum is invincible!
Hey, we might be able to do this! Give 'im the finishing blow!
Geh!
Urgh...
I knew it... Again!
The damage is disappearing from DIO's body...
It's just like when Johnny and Giorno fought him before!
This is it! His ability!
What, no more attacks? Are you done already?
Shall I go ahead and finish you off?
Ggh...
...
Overwriting reality?
!
You've figured out my Stand's power?
Thanks for the hint...
So what? It makes no difference...
Soon you'll come to know it better than you ever hoped for!
Ahh!!
Impossible! What is this?!
Hadn't you noticed?
The World Over Heaven already hit that turtle.
And now!
To overwrite reality!
!
Ahh! The turtle!
It disappeared!
I've just given you and your allies a terrific dose of my power and blasted them into various eras!
No normal human could possibly withstand this power!
Before long, their bodies will begin to wither away to nothing!
Just like a vampire who's been attacked with Hamon!
!
The only thing that can save them is the light of the Holy Corpse!
What the hell are you planning?
Hah hah hah... Is now really the time to be asking that?
Jotaro. I'm leaving this fight to you.
!
Thinking back on all we've seen, I believe you're the only one who has a chance of defeating him.
We'll do something about the others.
You're in charge of beating the living daylights out of him, Jotaro!
This will be the last battle, without a doubt...
...
Been a long time coming.
Yup. The curtain's coming down.
I'm staying behind.
We can fight him together. Right, Dad?
...
Hoo...
Even after following a holy corpse to get here,
I didn't think this would turn into such a bizarre adventure.
Hmph.
We've been waiting for you, scoundrels!
Feast your eyes on my ultimate Hamon attack!
Mr Zeppeli!
Caesar!
I'm sorry, you two...
I'll finish this quickly!
I'll stake the pride of the Zeppeli family on this!
We're going to defeat you!
I'll pour Hamon straight into you!
Yes, that's it! The sound of a successful Hamon!
Control your breathing, then create energy! Ruoooooh!
Amazing! That's the power of truly refined Hamon!
I just hit you with my ultimate Hamon!
Yes! Attaboy, Caesar!
Urgh... Where are we?
N-No, it can't be... We fell under DIO's control?
That's right, you idiot! Don't scare me like that!
What we ought to be scared of is DIO's power!
I can't believe he could instantly put the Zeppelis back under his control like that!
Still, it looks like we really can restore them with the corpse's light like before.
You two, stay here for a while and rest.
We've got to move forward!
Nyo ho ho! There you are, you filthy terrorists!
I'm going to beat you into next week! You can bet on that!
Gyro! You?!
Joshu...
I'll bring you back to normal no matter how many times it takes, Gyro!
I don't like you! I'm gonna crush you!
Yeah! Into tiny pieces!
You're finiiiished! Shiiiiit! Shiiiiit!
I just can't hold myself back, because I know I'm gonna kill you!
We're gonna flatten you like pancakes!
Just wait. I'm going to send you flying even farther next time!
Have you learned your lesson yet, shitbrain?
Nyo, ho ho ho! Flawless victory!
Is...is this...
Ow... OUCH! Wh-what happened?
Good! You're back to normal.
Gyro, just wait here for me.
It'll be over soon!
Early bird gets the worm, Six Bullets!
We won't let you get away with this!
Mista! And you're...
Koichi!
Great!
Now that I think about it, we've never fought before!
Don't underestimate my Reverb!
Aim right between the eyes!
Once my gun takes aim,
there's no escape. 100 shots, 100 hits!
Let 'em have it, Reverb!
Paralyze them!
No misses!
Now I'll splatter you! Reverb Act 3: FREEZE!!
Urgh... What happened?
Wait. I... What was I doing?
Yooo! Glad to see you're back to normal, Koichi.
All right! This'll do!
I got a little nervous when DIO started acting all high and mighty, but we're in good shape!
Now we just need to finish bringing everyone back to normal!
...
What's the matter, Giorno?
Well, something's bothering me.
I just can't figure out...
why DIO would make us do all this.
At first I thought it might be to split us up, but...
Now I wonder if his goal wasn't simply to make us fight.
What?!
Ah!
Whoa!
Huh?!
Dammit!
My...My strength...
Gwaah!
Waaah!
Waaah!
Gaahh!
Waaah!
Aaahhh!
Waaah!
Gwaagh!
Waaah!
Kyaaahhh!
Urggh!
Gwaagh!
Urggh!
Gwooh!
Grargrarh!
Gwaagh!
Waaah!
Waaah!
Urggh!
Kyaaahhh!
Waaah!
Gwooh!
Gwooh!
Urggh!
Gwaagh!
Waaah!
Kyaahh!
Gwaagh!
Gwooh!
Urggh!
Gwaagh!
Gwaagh!
Heh heh heh...
I see the pride and courage of the Joestar family has allowed them to triumph over destiny!
However!
The moment you did so, your souls' power reached its maximum!
!?
The time is ripe!
The souls of the Joestar family...
And the Holy Corpse...
Will now be mine!
!
Wh-what is that?!
Nnnnngh!
Ggh!
Ku ha ha ha ha ha!
It...It can't be...
Damn you! Their souls...and the Holy Corpse!
Hmph!
Now all that's left is the two of you!
Jotaro! You're up first!
Tch!
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDAAAAA!
D-Dad!
I figured I'd have to use The World Over Heaven's true ability to finish you off!
Nnnnngh!
I'm going to erase you from existence, Jotaro!
Gwaaaah!!
My hand will always reach reality...
A reality free of obstructions...
...
ORAAA!
Whaaaaat!?
Ugh!
Wh...
What...What is this?
This is...Over Heaven!
Jotaro! You re-overwrote the reality that I, DIO, chose?!
I-Impossible!
The same type of Stand!
The World and Star Platinum are the same type of Stand!
...
Dad...you countered his ability?
Bring it, DIO!
This is it! The final round!!
Show me your reality, Jotaro!
Show me the true power of Star Platinum!
This feeling... So this is Over Heaven...
The power to overwrite reality...
So this is your reality or whatever, DIO?
He's so strong! I've never seen my dad like this before!
No one can destroy the reality that I, DIO have created...
No!
It can't be!!
How is this possible?!
How could this Joestar descendant...
assimilate into my reality?!
Pfft... Reality?
I couldn't really see it... What happened to your body, Dad?
Fine! We'll decide whose reality is superior right here!
Let's finish this, Jotaro!
(In order to overwrite reality with The World Over Heaven...)
(I need an enormous amount of soul energy, and time to charge it.)
(Strengths and weaknesses are two sides of the same coin... There will always be some kind of trade off...)
No one can destroy my reality!
Know your plaaaace!
Heh heh heh...
Fu ha ha ha ha...
FU HA HA HA HAAAAAH!
!
Ugh!
Jotaro!
Allow me to complement you on your Stand, and your mental prowess!
Unfortunately...
Since you've just barely awakened to your ability...
You can't use Over Heaven properly!
MUDAAA!!
Ugggh!
Stone Ocean!
Hmph!
Waaah!
Jolyne!
Heh heh heh... One left!
Unbelievable... Never for a moment did I think you'd be able to intervene in my reality...
But by its very nature, there can only ever be one reality...
And the reality that I, DIO, create...is more than enough!
Ggh!
You have my gratitude.
Thanks to you, I gathered the Holy Corpse in no time at all,
and made it over to this main world without lifting a finger.
And now that I've obtained your souls, my Stand shall rise to even greater heights.
The Joestar bloodline...
It was always such a nuisance, like piles of dog shit strewn over the path of my destiny...
But at last, at the very end,
it turns out the Joestars were always destined to serve me!
Fu ha ha ha ha ha!
Shut...up!
Now then, Jotaro,
Last of the Joestar family...
I'm going to finish you off personally.
Heh heh heh heh.
All I have to do is blow your head off,
and the bloodline of my vile nemeses will disappear forever...
Joestars...
The last...
Bloodline...
Disappear...
Now diiiie! Jotaro!!
Disappear.
???
This armlet's from the main world...
Gwaaaah!!
Wh...Whaaaaat?!
What...is this?!
Gwaahh!!
You...You maggot! What are you...
So it's true...
Looks like your ability activates whenever your fist hits something.
!
You won't be overwriting any realities until that arm heals.
Ggghh...
(panting)
...
How many seconds will it take to heal?
Once it does, I'm smashing Star Platinum right into you!
C'mon!
MUDAAA!
How's that?! I've blinded you!
I've won! Now DI...
ORAAA!
GWAAAAHH!
You're a joke, DIO.
And your reality...
It's all just a fantasy.
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
ORAAAAAAAA!
GBWAAAAAAAHHHH!
Don't make me repeat myself...
You pissed me off.
!
Ngh!
...
Gimme a break.
ORAAAA!!
...
?
Oh Jotaro, there you are!
We got word from the hospital. They said you'd regained consciousness.
...
C'mon, let's get going!
?
What, something the matter?
Oh, nothing.
Those wounds were pretty serious. Looks like it's a month of complete rest.
All that's important is that we're all alive...
...
Sorry, Jean Pierre.
We've got to go back to Holly...
Yeah. Hurry home and put her at ease.
Just leave them to me.
I'll take good care of them.
I'll make sure to come back when it's discharge time.
I'll hold you to that.
Eleven years later... -1999-
Whoa!
Huh?!
Ahh! Ahh!
Strange... I felt like I hit something and fell down...
Sorry, I was looking the other way...
Looks like I lost track of her.
(H-He's huuuuge! He's gotta be over six feet tall!)
(Oh...)
(Wait...have I seen him somewhere before?)
...
...
Stay close to me.
You know, I wanted to leave you at home with your mom to watch over the place.
I only brought you along so you'd stop bawling and throwing tantrums.
Just keep quiet until my business is done. Got it?
Yeah!
I'm gonna go look at the turtle!
...
Gimme a break.
I've got a question for you...
Do you know the Higashikata family?
I came to this town...
...to pay them a visit.
Though the chains of destiny may bind you,
though you may be fated to fight,
know that a noble heart is as strong as a diamond,
and as free as golden wind in the sky.
Though you may be imprisoned in a sea of stone,
you can keep walking toward the light.
There's always a blessing waiting in the wings, and as
many signposts to guide you as there are stars in the sky.
Go now, and journey beyond the stars!
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven<lf>END
For now, we need to go after Bucciarati!
Find the Holy Corpse part.
Look around a bit more.
Have you heard about Kameyu Stickers?
The Kameyu department store in front of Morioh Town Station gives them out when you make a purchase.
According to Speedwagon, these stickers have been scattered around different eras.
How did stickers from a Japanese department store traverse time and space?
That's a very intriguing question... It really makes one wonder, doesn't it?
If we create a distribution map of how the stickers have been dispersed, it may give us a clue as to what's causing all of this.
If you find any Kameyu Stickers on the ground, could you bring them to me?
I'll provide you with fair compensation for your work, of course. I'm counting on you, okay?
Hi there. Have you brought any <color red>Kameyu Stickers</color>?
I await your next delivery!
We need to hurry up and find all the corpse parts!
The anomalies can be fixed with the corpse's power, and it's my duty to make sure that happens!
I don't know the details myself. The only thing I know for sure...
...is that the power of the Holy Corpse far surpasses anything the common man could comprehend!
Now that I'm with you Joestars, I have nothing to fear!
We just need to find the remaining Holy Corpse parts!
I can't believe old man Zeppeli got wrapped up in an anomaly...
I mean, I know they are capable of making unbelievable things happen...
But I never thought that Dio-no, DIO-would be the one behind them!
DIO, the kind of man who steals human life without a second thought!
Sure, he likes to use flowery words like "Heaven" and stuff, but he's rotten to the core!
...
Gimme a break.
...
What's wrong?
...
What do you want?
...
What?
...
Gimme a break...
I can't believe I have to fight DIO again...
...
Is there no limit to his power?
I need to come up with some kind of strategy or else I'll never defeat him!
I thought I'd be able to go back home to my daughter...
But it's not like I've got a choice! If this is how it's gonna be, count me in 'til the bitter end!
Never thought I'd ever travel to another dimension, though...
It's just one bizarre adventure after another...
With the Holy Corpse, we can instantly warp to any location in the world.
It took us forever to reach Cairo the first time...
But we also did our fair share of sightseeing, so in that respect it was a lot of fun! Wa ha ha ha!
A DIO from a parallel world?!
He was always a monster, but now he's become something truly inhuman!
Main world, parallel world, who cares?! We just need to defeat DIO!
It's our destiny!
C'mon, our journey's not over yet!
That Speedwagon guy seems like he has a few screws loose...
I guess I'll just have to hold it in.
I'm talking about going to the bathroom! You know, the toilet?!
I'm handsome AND delicate. When faced with a completely different kind of toilet, sometimes things that should come out just...don't!
Being inside the turtle for so long started to give me this weird feeling...
Kind of like the turtle and I were becoming one... You know what I mean? Is it just me?
Urgh! I don't see a single toilet around here!
Is it too much to ask for just one toilet where a nice guy like me could casually take care of his business?
DIO! This time I'm going to make sure my assassination succeeds!
DIO and all his underlings! I'm gonna slice them all to shreds!
I'm glad that everyone's safe, but...
I can't remember anything after passing out during the battle with DIO...
We need to save Avdol and Iggy as soon as possible.
I hope we can all take a picture together again someday...
Anomalies can turn even the best of friends into enemies...
We can't let our guard down, no matter who we meet.
Seeing our allies in the turtle really got me thinking...
Who knew that there were so many gifted people in our world?
The parallel world DIO!
This is our chance to stand up to DIO!
We need to figure out what his ability is and defeat him once and for all!

If all this is the work of a Stand User...
That means there's someone out there whose Stand power is the terrifying ability to transcend time.
As for the phenomenon of the dead coming back to life... Could it be...?
No, there's no way...
There must be some kind of logic to these anomalies.
Figuring out how they work should help us fix them!
Is the power of the Holy Corpse also derived from something Stand-related?
So that's DIO...
No, never mind.
I'm not really sure what's going on here,
but if means we'll get Bucciarati back, I'll gladly help out.
It's almost food time!
Gotta make sure I feed the Bullets. Is there still some food left inside the turtle?
I never really noticed it before, but it's actually pretty spacious inside the turtle...
We could probably fit around 20 more people in there.
No fighting! You hear me?!
Oh sorry, I was just feeding the Bullets.
C'mon! Be kind and share with each other! No. 3! Stop bullying No. 5!
Be nice to each other, you guys!
My Stand's more of the silent-killer type.
I'll bury these bullets right in DIO's brain. That'll solve everything!
I'm going to decide my own destiny.
I'm not going to run like a coward anymore. Bucciarati, Giorno, and everyone else taught me so much.
Bucciarati's going to come back too, like Narancia, right?
That's wonderful...
Things are getting lively inside the turtle.
The turtle is convenient and all, but I really wish it had a bathroom...
Overwriting reality?
That Stand's even more dangerous than Diavolo. We need to stop it!
But how can we stand up to reality itself?
Not even Requiem could stop it. What can we do?
The boss took me out before I even knew what was going on...
And then before I knew it, I was back to life again!
Why doesn't anything ever make sense around here?!
None of this crap makes sense!
We just gotta gather up the corpse parts, right? Then Bucciarati will come back!
Ahhh, I'm getting hungry!
I want a piping hot pizza! Margherita, loaded with porcini mushrooms!
Huh? I feel like I've said this line somewhere before...
Ahhh, I'm getting hungry!
I already ate all the chocolate... Isn't there anything else to eat around here?
Hmm, let's see...
Err, overwriting reality, right? Yep! That sounds like a really dangerous ability!
Still, all I need to do is slam Li'l Bomber into him, right? No? How come?
I-I don't get it...
Reality, overwriting, blah blah blah! None of this stuff makes any sense, damn it!
Oh no...
I forgot to tell my mom that I'd be going away for a while!
And it's not like "the Holy Corpse" is going to mean anything to Japanese people...
I know it's like, crazy powerful or whatever...
Damn it! I can't do a thing with my hair sometimes.
Oh! Wait, how's this look? Could this be it?
Great!
All this talk about worlds makes the whole thing feel so big...
This isn't something that a high schooler from Japan can deal with on his own!
But oh well—guess I've got no choice! I'll take care of that DIO guy!
Oh no...

Yukako, I promise I'll save you...
Just try to hold on a little bit longer!
I'm so worried about Yukako...
How can I sit still when someone could be hurting her right now!?
I wonder what Yukako's doing right now?
...
Yukako...
Our world is being invaded by people from ANOTHER world?!
How can we stop it? Isn't there anything we can do?
That guy's like something out of a sci-fi manga!
The more I try to think about the main world and the parallel worlds, the more confused I get...
It seems like something Rohan would really love.

I bet I could use this as the basis for my next masterpiece...
Mmm, things are really getting exciting! I hope something big happens soon!
Ah! That look on your face just now-it's perfect! Hold still, I'm going to sketch it.
...
Hmm...now it looks fake all of a sudden. I couldn't possibly use something like that in my work!
So, who was the Holy Corpse?
I've never heard of a corpse possessing such amazing power.
Oh! I like that expression on your face! Hold still, I'm going to sketch it.
...
Marvelous! I just drew the best face ever!
A main world and parallel worlds, huh?
I never thought I'd end up experiencing such a classic element of sci-fi...
A main world and parallel worlds...
I might as well take some notes. I could use this as the basis for a future one-shot.
Dio is complicit in these anomalies?
We must stop him at all costs!
I lost my father...my house... Everything...
But there's no time to lament! I need to stand up and face Dio and the anomalies!
Gathering the corpse parts is harder than it looks...
But we can't get hasty. We need to make sure we don't miss a single one.
Will we really be able to stop the anomalies with the Holy Corpse?
I feel an indescribable fear rushing over me... I can't shake it off.
If only Mr. Zeppeli were here...!
What?! Gathering up the corpse parts drew him into our world?!
We won't be able to fight him without the power of the corpse. But we can't rely on that alone, either...
We need to do something on our own!

Talk about a pain in the ass!
And I still have to take on the Pillar Men, too... This is a bad year for JoJos!
First a young Speedwagon, then a me from 50 years in the future, and then my own grandson...
Gimme a break! Who's next, my mother?!
A DIO from another world...
After seeing what he's capable of, even I'm starting to believe in the whole 'destiny' thing!
DIO is the mortal enemy of the entire Joestar lineage!
We need to smash that asshole into oblivion!
I'll just treat this anomaly incident like another phase of my training.
I need to learn how to channel even more powerful Hamon.
After making it through Lisa Lisa's training, I thought I had become as powerful as I would ever be,
but after fighting the Pillar Men on Air Supplena Island, I realized how naive I had been.
I'm still not strong enough yet-and the same goes for JoJo!
DIO...it all traces back to him...
Now we can finally avenge our grandfathers, who sacrificed their lives chasing the Stone Mask!

We'll help you gather the corpse parts.
Completing the Holy Corpse will allow us to fix the anomalies! Which means it'll also help us defeat the Pillar Men.
DIO is no average vampire, though...
He's undergone some kind of transcendence!
It seems we're destined to fight DIO.
No matter what Pucchi's planning, we have to prevent it!
We must stop him!
Can we really turn Weather back to normal?
I want to talk with him again... In that soft breeze...
The Heaven that Pucchi and DIO reached...
is bullshit!
We need to seal DIO's ability away!
No matter what it takes!
Goddamn Pucchi! What the hell is he after now?
One of his underlings killed my sister!
He's not getting away. I'm going to catch him if it's the last thing I do!
Birds of a feather...
Of COURSE Pucchi's friends are psychos.
This doesn't change the plan.
We'll just have to crush them both now!
No matter what Pucchi's planning—no matter what happens from here on out—I know what must be done.
I'm going to protect Jolyne...that's it.
Jolyne revived my dead heart.
I would gladly give my life for her.
I will defeat DIO!
For Jolyne's sake. That, and nothing more.
No matter what happens,
I'm going to protect Jolyne better than anyone else.

This might bring Gyro back...
There's hope...
What is Valentine planning?
The next time I see him, I'll finish him off with a nail bullet once and for all!
I can't believe it...
DIO is strong enough to make even Valentine surrender?
But Gyro taught me Tusk's spin himself... How could it not work?!
This might bring Gyro back...
There's hope...
What is Valentine planning?
The next time I see him, I'll finish him off with a nail bullet once and for all!
Japanese people are extremely polite, which actually just creeps me out.
But for some reason...
I feel like I could get along with you.
I want to know more about myself.
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll overcome any obstacle...
I need to keep moving forward.
I can't just stand around.
I want to learn about myself...!
If DIO gets in my way, I'll just have to defeat him!
I need to keep moving forward!
M-my head hurts...it's pounding.
It feels like someone punched me or something...
Yasuho is mine... (mutter mutter) No one else can have her... (mutter mutter)
What? What are you looking at?
Get away from me, moron!
Damn it...where's Yasuho?!
They tricked me! Damn it...damn it!
M-my head hurts...it's pounding.
It feels like someone punched me or something...
Yasuho is mine... (mutter mutter) No one else can have her... (mutter mutter)
What? What are you looking at?
Koichi, was it...?
I...I don't know why, but...
I feel like you and I could get along. Don't you agree?
Just forget that Josuke guy you're always hanging around! I don't even like his name!
Look at my body! It's fully-equipped for battle with the Pillar Men!
I'll show DIO what's what! They're going to pay dearly for controlling ME!
DIO! You'll pay for this!!
A single vampire is no match for the likes of me!
If I can't understand it after thinking really hard, then I just don't think about it at all! It's 'cause I'm an idiot, you know?!
I'll swipe away DIO and whoever else I need to! Then we'll be all done!

My breathing is telling me all I need to know...
You did a great job assembling so many powerful warriors.
I can't believe I let myself fall under enemy control...
I was unprepared, and I need to make up for it no matter what it takes!
I thought I was dead, but apparently I'm not! Guess I got lucky!
Now, I just gotta make sure that doesn't happen again! Nyo-ho!
Pizza mozzarella♪ Pizza mozzarella♪
Rellarellarellarella♪ Rellarellarellarella♪
Those high "re" notes are really hard to hit!
I thought my body perished in the battle with the boss...
But here I am, alive again.
Is it because we need to defeat DIO? Is that our duty now?
Either way, it's nice that we get to meet again.
I really feel alive again.
Koichi, you fought so hard for me...
Now it's my turn to fight for you!
Koichi, I don't care where we go-as long as we're together!
Where we go, or who the enemy is-none of it matters!
Because our love is invincible!
Koichi, you fought so hard for me...
Now it's my turn to fight for you!
Koichi, I don't care where we go-as long as we're together!
Where we go, or who the enemy is-none of it matters!
Because our love is invincible!
What happened? Does not compute...
Does not compute... Does not compute!
Oh!
I just remembered dat I saved some gum dat I only chewed a little bit in my pocket! Lucky me! Shee shee!
(munch munch munch)
I don't want you wrapping me up in any of this trouble!
Now that I've got Chili Pepper, I'm going to use it to make my life super fun and awesome, man!
Is this guitar cool or what? Want to play it a little bit?
Nope! Only I'm allowed to touch it! Gee hee hee!
Yoooo! Let's keep it mellow, alright?
I have a feeling you and I will get along very well...
Is this guitar cool or what? Want to play it a little bit?
Here! Don't break it, now!
I'm going to put an end to Pucchi's twisted way of thinking, and our tragic destiny...
That's the one thing that will never change...
My memories of Jolyne and her allies have been restored, but that still doesn't solve anything...
Still, it's not a bad feeling...
Mmm... I feel like I just awoke from a very long dream.
It...almost feels like I'm still dreaming.
I was attacked in DIO's Mansion, and... Then what happened?
I don't really remember what happened, but I'm glad everyone's okay.
What a relief...

This is a story of the fate that bound the Joestar family with DIO for over a century... In modern-day Japan, Joseph Joestar's grandson Jotaro Kujo and his friends journey to Egypt to save his mother Holly and defeat DIO. But just before they can stop DIO once and for all, Jotaro's allies Avdol and Iggy fall in battle, and DIO himself murders Kakyoin. Then Old Joseph and Jean Pierre get incapacitated, leaving Jotaro to face DIO all by himself!
Despite losing his allies, Jotaro takes on DIO in Cairo and manages to defeat him. Then, Jotaro finds a note from DIO. Upon reading it, a strange feeling overtakes him, and he burns the note... With their journey at an end, Old Joseph and Jotaro say farewell to Jean Pierre at Cairo Airport—but before they can finish saying goodbye, an unexpected visitor appears!
Avdol, Iggy, and N'doul, who should all be dead, descend upon the confused Jotaro and his allies. Then a man calling himself Speedwagon appears, and uses the power of his "Holy Corpse" to release Kakyoin from the anomaly. Following the commotion, Speedwagon explains the situation: in order to put an end to the anomalies happening the world over, he needs help gathering the pieces of the Holy Corpse.
Speedwagon guides Jotaro and his allies through the Light Rift, which transports them to the Colosseum in Italy, in the year 2001. Jotaro gets split up from his allies, but happens to run into Giorno and his crew, who have just won a gang war!
An anomaly just like the one that affected Avdol and Iggy has beset Giorno's crew. Jotaro and Giorno fend off an assault from Fugo and Narancia, but let Bucciarati—the team leader—get away. Chasing after Bucciarati, Jotaro and Giorno pass through another Light Rift and arrive at Neapolis Train Station!
Giorno and Jean Pierre manage to defeat Bucciarati and Cool Ice, but fail to release Bucciarati from the anomaly. Upon reuniting with Old Joseph's group, they officially team up with Giorno and his allies. They then discover a surprising link between Jean Pierre and the gangsters...
Jotaro and his crew move on to the next age: Morioh Town, a suburban city in Japan. For reasons unknown, this deeply unsettles Old Joseph, who sets off on his own, drawing heavy suspicion from Jotaro. Then, Josuke and Koichi pass by the group on their way home from school...
It turns out that the anomalies have reached Morioh Town! Jotaro helps Josuke and his friends defeat Okuyasu, Yukako, Shigechi, and Otoishi; and succeeds in releasing Rohan from the anomaly. But before they can celebrate their victory, Enyaba and her fog-manipulating Stand appear with a horde of corpse puppets and lay siege to the town!
After defeating Enyaba, Jotaro explains the situation to Koichi and Rohan, who agree to help. Jotaro and Josuke search the area, and succeed in finding a new part of the Holy Corpse. As soon as Josuke sees it, he decides to use it to play a trick on Rohan.
Old Joseph finds an instant camera, and uses Hermit Purple on it to try and discover who's behind the anomalies. He's shocked when the photo reveals the man he and his allies risked their lives to defeat—DIO!
Jotaro and his allies trace their fate back to where it all began: The Joestar Residence. There, they find Jonathan doing his best to fend off an army of zombies. In order to save his ancestor, Jotaro steps up to fight!
Jotaro's group emerges victorious, despite the twin threats of Dio's vampiric abilities and Diego's dinosaur Stand. But they have no time to relax, for soon after, Zeppeli and Mariah attack! The group holds them off, and Speedwagon returns his Holy Corpse part to its rightful owner: Jonathan Joestar.
Jonathan—weary from single-handedly fending off the zombie horde—is escorted inside the turtle by Speedwagon for some much-needed rest. Old Joseph gets kicked off the sofa in order to make room.
After arriving on Air Supplena Island, Jotaro and his friends encounter two young men who have been using the island for their Hamon training—Joseph and Caesar. The duo are suspicious of Jotaro and Old Joseph, and are about to kick them off the island when a very malicious-looking Lisa Lisa and Stroheim suddenly appear and attack!
Jotaro and the crew defeat Stroheim and release Lisa Lisa from the anomaly, but Joseph remains suspicious. Old Joseph explains who they really are and why they've come, but then Hol Horse arrives, with orders to shoot on sight!
Immediately after Hol Horse retreats, the Pillar Men assault Air Supplena Island. Joseph and Caesar bravely fight to keep them away from the Red Stone of Aja, setting the stage for an all-out war between the Pillar Men and the Hamon warriors. Fortunately, Old Joseph comes up with a clever way to ends things peacefully.
After the confrontation with the Pillar Men, Jotaro finds a part of the Holy Corpse on the island. As soon as Joseph sees it, he decides to use it to play a trick on Caesar.
Jotaro and the gang arrive in Cape Canaveral, only to find it at the mercy of a strange gravitational force. Meanwhile, Jolyne and Emporio are busy running away from their allies, who have all gone berserk thanks to another anomaly. Joylne is stunned when she runs into a younger version of her father Jotaro, but decides to team up with him to fend off Ermes and Anastasia.
After defeating Weather and releasing Ermes and Anastasia from the anomaly, Jotaro and his allies come face to face with Father Pucchi, who seems to know a lot about recent events. Jotaro prepares for a fight—sensing that Pucchi is somehow connected to the one behind the anomalies—but Pucchi departs, uttering a strange phrase: "Eyes of Heaven."
Rohan has created a report summarizing the rogue research he did on the anomalies and the circumstances surrounding them. Reading it might shed some light on what's happening...
Jotaro and his allies find another Light Rift, but only Jonathan and Josuke are able to pass through it into the next age. Meanwhile, Jolyne explores Morioh Town and runs into a strange man... Darby Elder, the gambler who once lost to Jotaro! He steals Jolyne's soul, and challenges Jotaro to another poker duel!
Jonathan arrives on the Philadelphia Coastline, interrupting a battle between Johnny and Valentine. Before departing, Valentine oddly advises them to "keep collecting the corpse parts." Upon earning Johnny's trust, Jonathan passes through the Light Rift into the next age.
The next stop is Rocky Mountain Village, a location Johnny passed through during the race. Lurking within the village are Dio and Diego, setting the stage for a fated battle of blood, claws, Hamon and fangs that transcends worlds!
After Jonathan and Johnny defeat Dio and Diego, they come face to face with Gyro, back from the dead. He's teamed up with Valentine, who strangely enough, isn't attacking to kill. The odd attacks make Jonathan suspicious, and he begins to wonder if he's being tested for some reason...
After finding a new part of the Holy Corpse, Johnny can't hide his disappointment that it's only one of many pieces. Jonathan does his best to encourage his ally, and their journey continues.
Josuke 4 arrives at the Higashikata Residence just in time to see an anomaly manifest itself. A strange mist surrounds Joshu and makes him go berserk, upon which he suddenly attacks Josuke 8. The two Josukes team up and manage to release Joshu from the anomaly, just as a strange dark shadow falls over them!
Two Josukes and two Yoshikage Kiras... Kira and Kawajiri have come to the Higashikata Residence in search of a peaceful life, but the two Josukes now stand in their way. Josuke 8 fights to find out more about his identity, but Josuke 4 just wants to give Kira another smackdown!
After finding another corpse part, Josuke 8 decides to keep traveling with Josuke 4 in the hopes of finding more clues about his lost memories.
Jonathan and Josuke 4 safely arrive back in Morioh Town, along with their new allies Johnny and Josuke 8, and the eight corpse parts that they've managed to collect. But where could the last part be? Mocking their distress, Enyaba appears and attacks them once more.
Jotaro and the gang defeat Enyaba at the last minute, only to see her let out a triumphant shout and disappear into the light. Soon after, everyone gets sucked into a strange dimension. Awaiting them there is the man behind the anomalies—DIO, Gone to Heaven.
After DIO, Gone to Heaven steals the Holy Corpse parts, Jotaro and his allies find themselves back on Air Supplena Island. While they're venting their frustration, Valentine appears and spars with Jotaro. After the dust settles, Valentine confidently declares that Jotaro's Stand is the same type as the new Stand that DIO, Gone to Heaven has acquired—meaning that Jotaro has a chance of beating him!
In order to gather more data on DIO, Gone to Heaven, Jotaro challenges Darby to poker again, risking his own soul for Darby's corpse part! After Jotaro wins, Darby hands over his corpse part and reveals the secret to DIO, Gone to Heaven's ability. According to Darby, Father Pucchi has the information that Jotaro seeks.
Following Valentine's advice, Jotaro and his crew start gathering the Holy Corpse parts once more. And so, they set off for the different ages to defeat their allies and release them from the anomalies again, trusting that it's the only way to defeat DIO, Gone to Heaven.
After visiting the Cairo Overpass, Jotaro discovers DIO's Armlet, which had fallen by the side of the road. "If an object from the main world comes in contact with an object from an alternate world, they'll both disappear..." Remembering Valentine's words, Jotaro pockets the armlet, hoping he'll be able to use it in his battle with DIO, Gone to Heaven.
After retrieving Bucciarati at Neapolis Train Station, Jotaro and his allies travel to G.D. St. Prison, where they run into Yukako and the murderous Kira-Kawajiri duo. Koichi fights hard to save Yukako, and the group earns another corpse part after defeating the two Kiras.
DIO, Gone to Heaven and Pucchi bring their machinations to the Joestar Residence, where they announce that they need the souls of 36 sinners in order to complete their plan. The Holy Corpse parts were nothing but tools used to lead Jotaro and his allies right into their trap!
Valentine finds himself in a tight spot when his betrayal comes to light. DIO, Gone to Heaven orders him to pledge allegiance and gently offers his hand, but Valentine refuses, instead attacking in order to carry out his own personal brand of justice! Unfortunately, he is quickly eliminated in the face of DIO, Gone to Heaven's mysterious power.
After Jotaro defeats Shigechi and Otoishi, Weather Forecast steps up to fight. Thanks to the hard work of Jolyne and her allies the Devil's Rainbow disappears, and they succeed in releasing Weather Forecast from the anomaly.
While on their quest collect the corpse parts, Jotaro and his crew succeed in defeating Diavolo, Dio, and Diego. They finally come face to face with Avdol and Iggy, and—after a violent battle—succeed in releasing them from the anomaly. At long last, Jotaro, Kakyoin, Jean Pierre, and Old Joseph are reunited with their old friends.
Pucchi awaits the crew at the Joestar Residence—the place where it all began. Jotaro fights and defeats Pucchi in order to figure out the secret of DIO, Gone to Heaven's ability. Pucchi takes his own life in response, believing that what DIO, Gone to Heaven is working toward will lead the human race to true happiness.
Jotaro and his allies finally take on DIO, Gone to Heaven, but find themselves powerless against his godlike Stand ability. "Overwriting reality"... Jotaro figures out DIO, Gone to Heaven's ability only to watch as he overwrites the reality of his allies, scattering them across the ages once more.
Jotaro and his crew succeed in freeing their friends from the chains of DIO, Gone to Heaven's reality. But then—as if he had been waiting for this moment—DIO, Gone to Heaven steals everyone's souls, leaving only Jotaro and Jolyne. The final battle is about to begin!
After defeating DIO, Gone to Heaven, Jotaro feels his own mind slip away into the light... Only to wake up back in Cairo; in a world where Kakyoin, Avdol, and Iggy have all survived the battle with DIO. Feeling uneasy and relieved at the same time, Jotaro gets on a plane and returns to Japan. Years later in 1999, Jotaro visits Morioh Town with his young daughter Jolyne, and so the story is passed on...

1988, Egypt — As the curtain rises on the final battle with DIO, Jotaro and his allies split into two groups in an attempt to corner their enemy. Kakyoin and Joseph desperately defend themselves from DIO's onslaught as they try to figure out his Stand's secret. But then...
Japan, 1999: Yoshikage Kira assumed the identity of Kosaku Kawajiri in order to hide out in Morioh Town, but Josuke Higashikata and Okuyasu Nijimura have finally ripped off his sheep's clothing! With his cover blown, Kawajiri tries to blow them both up. Can Josuke and Okuyasu defeat this cold-hearted killer?
Josuke and Okuyasu have reunited with their allies and succeeded in cornering Yoshikage Kira! But little did they know that Kira still has a trump card—a third bomb, which only activates when he's completely out of options! Koichi and Josuke do their best to stop Kira from escaping, but...!
Italy, 2001: Dio's son Giorno teams up with Bucciarati's gang on a mission to protect Trish, their boss's daughter, but rebel once they discover that the boss actually wants her dead! In a showdown at the Colosseum in Rome, Giorno and Diavolo desperately fight for ownership of the arrow artifact, which has the power to evolve Stands. In the end, Giorno succeeds in reaching the arrow!
America, 2011: Father Pucchi succeeded in evolving his Stand into a brand new one—Full Moon, which gives him the ability to reverse gravity in relation to his own body. In retaliation, Jolyne Cujoh teams up with Narc Anastasia to put a stop to the mad priest once and for all!
At Cape Canaveral, Jolyne's deathmatch with Father Pucchi continues! Thanks to the gravitational power of Full Moon, Pucchi is able to "complete" his ability without waiting for the new moon. "The Time of Heaven" has arrived! Meanwhile Anastasia tries to get Jotaro to approve of his marriage to Jolyne, in order to energize himself for the battle.
America, 1890: Amid the excitement of the Steel Ball Run race, a secret war is being waged over the Holy Corpse. After finding the left arm, Johnny and Gyro continue the race while searching for the other parts. As the sun sets, the pair—along with Diego—stop to rest in a village in the foothills. Once they get there, Diego begins exhibiting some strange behavior, and Johnny slowly starts to realize just what's brewing beneath the surface...
Egypt, 1988: The Joestar gang heads to Egypt in order to defeat DIO and save Jotaro's mother, Holly. Before long, they're intercepted by an assassin named Death 13, who pulls Old Joseph, Jotaro, and Jean Pierre into his dream world and forces them into a one-sided battle.
As the battle intensifies, Lisa Lisa finds herself concerned about Jonathan and Joseph, who still have yet to fully complete their Hamon training. They have the potential to become so much stronger! She teams up with Caesar in order to give them the final lesson they need!
The only way to strengthen yourself is to take on someone stronger than you! With assistance from Jonathan's master, Zeppeli, Lisa Lisa creates an even better regimen. Will Jonathan and Joseph be able to complete her training? This is it—the final trial!
At the place where it all began, Jonathan reunites with Dio, and Johnny with Diego. Hamon and blood, fangs and claws—a fated battle that transcends time and space begins once more! Will the victor possess a golden spirit or a pitch-black will? The threads of fate shall be bound here!
It's just another day at the Higashikata Residence as Josuke 4 and Josuke 8—the two Josuke Higashikatas—deepen their friendship while hanging out with Koichi. Meanwhile, Joshu openly vents his disgust over Josuke 4's "delinquent" appearance, even going as far as saying, "Thugs these days wouldn't be caught dead with that kind of haircut!"
The final battle with the Pillar Men has begun! First, Joseph and Caesar go up against Kars and Wamuu. The flames of Caesar's hatred for Kars rage on as he vows to avenge his father's death. Will Joseph be able to defeat the Pillar Men now that Caesar's lost his cool?!
Next up are Kars and Esidisi—the two strongest Pillar Men—who have lived for centuries! Lisa Lisa steps up in place of Caesar to fight alongside Joseph.
Past and future... A fated battle that spans over 100 years... Jonathan and Dio, Jotaro and DIO—these men from across the ages were never meant to meet! This encounter will forever alter their destinies. Will their fate fade into obscurity, or will a new hope be passed on to the future?
The Zeppeli clan has guided the Joestar family with the power of Hamon across several eras. Like blood brothers, the men from both clans have combined their powers and fought through the ages. Jonathan and Zeppeli, Joseph and Caesar—the bonds of Hamon have endured, unbroken, for over 50 years! Powered by mutual trust, their Hamon are about to clash!
Blood is thicker than water—and within blood lies inescapable destiny. In the face of adversity, Giorno and Trish stand back to back. They already understand it in their hearts—both of their fathers are the embodiments of the evil they must defeat!
DIO and Pucchi must be stopped! In order to keep them from collecting all that's necessary for the "Time of Heaven," Jotaro and Jolyne transcend time itself to fight together. For the first time, Jolyne feels a passion stirring in her young father's heart...
After coming face to face with Kira and Kawajiri, Josuke and Okuyasu are faced with murderous bloodlust! The killers who lurk in Morioh Town will stop at nothing to acquire a twisted sense of "peace," but Josuke and Okuyasu aren't about to let that happen!
Neither Yukako nor Anastasia will back down from love, be it Yukako's love for Koichi, or Anastasia's love for Jolyne. As they converse about their love, they gradually grow impassioned, and things boil over into a full-fledged Stand battle! Koichi and Jolyne try and stop them, touching off a battle of invincible loves!
After visiting G.D. St. Prison, Old Joseph and Jean Pierre are attacked by Iggy and Animal Shop! Trapped in a cage with two ferocious animals, the two friends have no choice but to fight for their lives!
As Giorno and the gang search for the Holy Corpse, Diavolo appears before them once more, with Fugo of all people! In order to stop Diavolo and release Fugo from the anomaly, Bucciarati and Trish step up to fight!
Giorno and his allies managed to release Fugo from the anomaly; unfortunately he was unable to go on traveling with his old friends. As they continue their search, Diavolo appears once more and demands a rematch. Squeezing out the last of his strength, Diavolo overpowers Giorno! But then, after overcoming his regrets of the past, Fugo returns to lend a hand!
When Old Joseph made plans for a friendly sparring match, it was clear to Jolyne that he was only doing it to try and act like a real father to Josuke. Which begs the question: What about her father? Does Jotaro care about looking good in front of his future daughter?
Josuke and Jolyne's fathers are both old soldiers past their primes. As Old Joseph and Jotaro realize this, an unspeakable feeling of dread overtakes them. Will these two fathers be able to restore some of their old dignity?!
Dio and Diego have teamed up temporarily in order to put an end to the Joestars once and for all. Upon spotting Johnny and Jotaro in Cairo, they launch a surprise assault!
The two Dios are hungry. Johnny and Gyro have inherited a lot, but in order to defeat Dio and Diego, they need to be hungry as well!
Jotaro and DIO are unable to mask their surprise when they come face to face with their future progeny. Jolyne has inherited the noble soul of the Joestar family. Giorno has inherited all of DIO's charisma, in addition to the golden spirit of the Joestar family. Now, the immortal souls of these fathers and their children are about to clash!
The apple never falls far from the tree. The same evil that lurks inside their fathers lurks inside them as well! Giorno and Trish fight alongside their fathers, but what side of them will they see?
Jean Pierre and Avdol have more than a bone to pick with Hol Horse and Mariah, two of DIO's assassins. Mariah can control magnetism, while Hol Horse can control the bullets he fires. Even though they were defeated in the past, they remain powerful foes. Will Jean Pierre and Avdol be able to beat them again?!
G.D. St. Prison has sealed the fate for many a person. In this stone ocean, Jolyne demanded freedom—now, together with her best friend Ermes, she rises up to defeat her nemeses once and for all!
Bewitched by DIO's charisma, N'doul and Mariah decide to launch a Nine Glory Gods counterattack! They've never fought together before, but don't underestimate them—these assassins become a force to be reckoned with! Will Jotaro and Old Joseph be able to stop them on their own?!
Trish has just awoken to her Stand ability, and all the power that spills out from her body overwhelms her. Luckily, she has Giorno, Mista, and Narancia there to lend a hand, and their gentle smiles help Trish open her heart.
An anomaly has made Weather go berserk! Desperate to save her ally, Jolyne teams up with Anastasia and starts to chase Weather down. "I just wish I could talk with him again..."
A truly bizarre match awaited Jean Pierre and Joseph on Air Supplena Island: Hol Horse and Stroheim! Hol Horse, the man who can control the bullets he fires, and Stroheim, the man who turned his entire body into a weapon—will Jean Pierre and Joseph be able to handle all that firepower?!
Otoishi has teamed up with the greedy Shigechi and used his Stand to commit a heist worth five billion yen. Josuke and Okuyasu have had it with their greed!
"Where's Yasuho?!" That's all Joshu seems to say these days. He's so insistent, in fact, that he ends up reminding Koichi of Yukako. A hater of delinquents, Joshu pesters Josuke by asking incessantly if he knows anything about Yasuho.
A showdown between the Joestars and the Zeppelis—a battle that transcends worlds! These duos have developed the arts of Hamon and Spin in their own ways, but how will they settle things once and for all? The one who comes out on top in the end may well prove to be the duo with the stronger bond!
Rohan Kishibe embarks on a mission to study how angry Josuke gets when his hair is insulted in order to find new material for his manga. Koichi tries to stop him, but Rohan simply won't listen. And so, he finds Josuke talking with Okuyasu and immediately utters the forbidden phrase yet again. "Josuke, I think I might have said this to you before, but—do you really think that haircut looks cool?"
Animal Shop, the Gatekeeper of Hell and Cool Ice, the Miasma from the Void. They were DIO's closest allies, and possess formidable power. Will Jean Pierre and Iggy be able to survive against these supervillains?!
While Jonathan trains himself, Kars and Esidisi launch an assault to exterminate the Hamon warriors. Jonathan teams up with his master Zeppeli in order to launch a counterattack, but do they have any hope of winning against beings that are even stronger than vampires?
Valentine and Diego travel to Air Supplena Island in search of the Holy Corpse. Their bizarre abilities send shivers down the spines of Joseph and Caesar. Will Hamon alone be able to defeat a Stand?
Jean Pierre and Iggy managed to break into DIO's Mansion, but just as the sun went down, DIO and his right-hand man Cool Ice reared their evil heads. Not only Stand users, but vampires as well; these two truly are the worst possible combination, but Jean Pierre and Iggy won't go down without a fight!

Hol Horse has chosen DIO as his third partner! In order to defeat the Joestars once and for all, Hol Horse teams up with DIO and Centerfold to attack Jotaro and Old Joseph head-on!
In what order do you eat your animal crackers? It all started with an innocuous question, but now a Stand battle is about to break out! Josuke and Rohan vs. Okuyasu and Shigechi, fighting over the dumbest thing in history! Do you eat the camel first, or last?!
The bitter battle for the arrow continues, and Bucciarati's team is still fighting strong. After losing his temper with Trish, Diavolo calls in his final reinforcement: Fugo, who left the team at San Giorgio Maggiore! Mista aims his pistol at his old ally, but...!
In order to stop his evil brother once and for all, Weather teams up with Anastasia to take on Pucchi. But Pucchi has teamed up with someone, too—Cool Ice! DIO sent forth his right-hand man to protect his best friend, and now an all-out Stand massacre is about to begin!
As Johnny and Gyro hurry to complete the race, new assassins appear! Wamuu, who possesses superhuman abilities that Gyro's never seen before, and Animal Shop, who can shoot ice as projectiles! Will Johnny be able to overcome this unprecedented trial?!
For some reason, Joshu and Speedwagon were having themselves a little chat, when suddenly DIO and Pucchi appeared! These foes possess unparalleled power, but Joshu and Speedwagon just can't bear to watch them go unpunished! And so, these two nearly ordinary combatants take on two of the greatest villains the world's ever seen!

The license granted to BNEA, and the above<lf>  waiver of any applicable moral rights, shall survive any termination of this EULA.<lf><lf>7. ONLINE CONDUCT.<lf>7.1. BNEA does not pre-screen content of postings or online chats in the Game and<lf>  does not assume any responsibility or liability for User-Generated Content.<lf>  BNEA does not assume any liability for any failure to remove, or any delay in<lf>  removing, User-Generated Content.  Without limiting any of its other rights and<lf>  remedies under this EULA or applicable law, if BNEA objects to any<lf>  User-Generated Content for any reason, BNEA, in its sole discretion may (either<lf>  itself or, if applicable, by request to a third-party service provider): (a) remove<lf>  the User-Generated Content; (b) give warnings to applicable persons; and/or<lf>  (c) restrict, suspend, or terminate access to and use of the Game without any<lf>  notice or liability. <lf>7.2.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO<lf>  EVENT SHALL BNEA, ITS SUPPLIERS, ITS LICENSORS, OR THEIR<lf>  RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR<lf>  AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT,<lf>  EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER<lf>  ARISING OUT OF THE POSSESSION OF, ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR<lf>  INABILITY TO USE THE GAME, OR THE FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT<lf>  SERVICES, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY<lf>  OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF<lf>  THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION,<lf>  BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, PERSONAL INJURY, PRODUCTS<lf>  LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY OTHER<lf>  THEORY.  IN ANY CASE AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY<lf>  APPLICABLE LAW, BNEA'S, ITS LICENSORS', AND SUPPLIERS'<lf>  ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL DAMAGES UNDER THIS EULA<lf>  SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR<lf>  THE GAME.  <lf>8.2. BNEA AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS MAKE NO PROMISE OR<lf>  WARRANTY THAT THE GAME WILL WORK PROPERLY.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE<lf>  AND AGREE THAT BNEA AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS ARE NOT<lf>  RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR (A) ANY VIRUSES OR OTHER DISABLING<lf>  FEATURES THAT AFFECT YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE GAME,<lf>  (B) ANY INCOMPATIBILITY AMONG THE GAME, OTHER SERVICES, AND<lf>  HARDWARE, OR (C) ANY DELAYS OR FAILURES YOU MAY EXPERIENCE<lf>  IN INITIATING, CONDUCTING, OR COMPLETING ANY TRANSMISSIONS OR<lf>  TRANSACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE GAME IN AN ACCURATE OR<lf>  TIMELY MANNER.  THE GAME AND ALL OTHER SERVICES ARE PROVIDED<lf>  "AS IS."  EXCEPT AS MIGHT BE DESCRIBED HEREIN, BNEA AND ITS<lf>  LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES<lf>  OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,<lf>  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE,<lf>  NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A<lf>  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  BNEA does not ensure continuous, error-free, secure,<lf>  or virus-free operation of any online, multi-player, or downloadable portions<lf>  of the Game or continued operation or availability of any given server.<lf>  Some countries/regions do not allow limitations as to how long an implied<lf>  warranty lasts and/or exclusions or limitations of consequential damages,<lf>  so the above limitations and/or exclusions of liability may not apply to you.<lf>  This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other<lf>  legal rights that vary from country/region to country/region.<lf>8.3. BNEA is not liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from any<lf>  causes beyond its reasonable control.  Further, BNEA cannot and does not<lf>  promise or ensure that you will be able to access the online, multi-player,<lf>  or downloadable portions of the Game whenever you want, and there may be<lf>  extended periods of time when you cannot access such portions of the Game.<lf><lf>9. TERMINATION/SUSPENSION.<lf>9.1. This EULA is effective upon your agreement to be bound by its terms and<lf>  remains in effect until terminated by you or BNEA. You may terminate this<lf>  EULA at any time by deleting and destroying any and all copies of the Game<lf>  in your possession, custody, or control.<lf>9.2. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, BNEA may limit, suspend,<lf>  or terminate the licenses granted hereunder and your access to and use of the<lf>  Game, including, but not limited to Virtual Items and any related services<lf>  and products, at any time and for any reason without notice or liability to you.<lf>9.3. Without limiting any other rights of BNEA, if you fail to comply with the terms<lf>  and conditions of this EULA, BNEA retains the right, in its sole discretion, to<lf>  immediately limit, suspend, or terminate your access to and/or use of the Game.<lf>9.4. Upon termination of this EULA, your rights to access and use the Game,<lf>  including any licenses and access to Virtual Items, user data, points, character<lf>  progress, and any other information of any kind related to the Game, will<lf>  terminate immediately, and you must cease all use of the Game.  In the event<lf>  the Game is terminated, you must destroy all copies of the Game and all of<lf>  its component parts.<lf>9.5. The termination of this EULA will not affect BNEA's rights or your obligations<lf>  arising under this EULA.  Those terms that by their nature are intended to<lf>  survive this EULA shall survive this EULA.<lf><lf>10. PRIVACY.  BNEA respects your privacy rights.  Any personal information<lf>  supplied by you to BNEA online or via any BNEA-controlled website will be<lf>  subject to the privacy policy posted at:<lf>  http://www.bandainamcoent.com/company/privacy.html.  Notwithstanding what<lf>  is stated in the applicable privacy policy, if you use any online services, such as<lf>  online play or the downloading and uploading of content, BNEA may also collect,<lf>  use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play<lf>  (including ID, play log, play data (level, item), specifications of local<lf>  machines, and residence regions), or identify content that is created and shared<lf>  by you with other players.<lf><lf>11. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  The Game has been developed<lf>  entirely at private expense and is provided as a "Commercial Computer Game"<lf>  or "restricted computer Game." Use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S.<lf>  Government or a U.S. Government subcontractor is subject to the restrictions<lf>  set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and<lf>  Computer Game clauses in DFARS 252.227-7013 or as set forth in subparagraphs<lf>  (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Game Restricted Rights clauses at<lf>  FAR 52.227-19, as applicable.  The Contractor/Manufacturer is<lf>  BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc., 5-37-8 Shiba, Minato-ku,<lf>  Tokyo 108-0014, Japan.<lf><lf>12. INJUNCTION.  Because BNEA would be irreparably damaged if the terms of<lf>  this EULA were not specifically enforced, you agree that BNEA and/or its<lf>  licensors and suppliers shall be entitled, without bond, other security<lf>  or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to<lf>  breaches of this EULA, in addition to such other remedies as BNEA may<lf>  otherwise have under applicable law.<lf><lf>13. INDEMNITY.  You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless BNEA, its<lf>  licensors, its suppliers, and each of their respective officers, directors,<lf>  employees, and agents from all damages, losses, and expenses, including<lf>  reasonable attorneys' fees, arising, directly or indirectly, from any<lf>  violation of this EULA by you or from your acts and omissions to act in<lf>  using the Game.  BNEA reserves the right to assume the exclusive<lf>  defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.<lf><lf>14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION/BINDING ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER.<lf>14.1. YOU AND BNEA AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS<lf>  BETWEEN YOU AND BNEA IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION.<lf>  THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF<lf>  OR RELATING TO: (A) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU<lf>  AND BNEA; (B) THIS EULA; OR (C) YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE GAME.<lf>  IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN<lf>  CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION,<lf>  MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.<lf>14.2. However, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or<lf>  disputes, which you or BNEA may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims<lf>  of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such<lf>  claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any<lf>  alleged unauthorized use, piracy, or theft.<lf>14.3. This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention<lf>  of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows,<lf>  seek relief from BNEA for you.<lf>14.4. An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a<lf>  judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court and provides more<lf>  limited discovery.  It follows different rules than court proceedings and is subject<lf>  to very limited review by courts.  The arbitrator will issue a written decision and<lf>  provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  YOU UNDERSTAND<lf>  THAT YOU AND BNEA ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND<lf>  TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.<lf>14.5. You and BNEA agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally<lf>  resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.  A party who intends to seek<lf>  arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature<lf>  and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.  If you and<lf>  BNEA do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days<lf>  after the notice is received, you or BNEA may commence an arbitration.  Written<lf>  notice to BNEA must be sent via postal mail to: ATTN: Legal & Business Affairs<lf>  Department, BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc., 2051 Mission College<lf>  Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95054, USA.<lf>14.6. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section.  The arbitration will be<lf>  governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration<lf>  Association ("AAA") and, where applicable, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures<lf>  for Consumer Related Disputes, both of which are available at http://www.adr.org.<lf>  The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this EULA.<lf>14.7. The AAA will administer the arbitration.  It may be conducted through the<lf>  submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the country/region where<lf>  you live or at another mutually agreed location.<lf>14.8. If you seek $10,000 or less, BNEA agrees to reimburse your filing fee and<lf>  your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator<lf>  compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator<lf>  determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined<lf>  by the arbitrator.  BNEA agrees not to seek its attorneys' fees or costs in<lf>  arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs<lf>  are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.  If you seek more than<lf>  $10,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be<lf>  split between you and BNEA according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules<lf>  and the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, if<lf>  applicable.<lf>14.9. YOU AND BNEA AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS<lf>  OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION,<lf>  OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA's PROCEDURES OR RULES<lf>  WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE.  THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF<lf>  ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY<lf>  TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.<lf>  You and BNEA also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with<lf>  any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this<lf>  EULA and all other actions or arbitrations.<lf>14.10. If the agreement in this Section not to bring or participate in a class or<lf>  representative action, private attorney general action, or collective arbitration<lf>  should be found illegal or unenforceable, you and BNEA agree that it shall not<lf>  be severable, that this entire Section shall be unenforceable, and any claim or<lf>  dispute would be resolved in court and not in collective arbitration.<lf>14.11. Notwithstanding this Section, you have the right to litigate any dispute in<lf>  small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including<lf>  any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute, are<lf>  satisfied.<lf>14.12. This Section shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable<lf>  law. If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the<lf>  provisions of this Section, notwithstanding Section 16 (Governing Law), such<lf>  provisions will not apply to you.<lf><lf>15. GOVERNING LAW.  Any dispute not subject to arbitration, or where no<lf>  election to arbitrate has been made, will be decided by the state or federal<lf>  court located in Santa Clara County, California, and you and BNEA agree to<lf>  submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.  Except as otherwise set<lf>  forth herein, this EULA shall be governed by, and will be construed under,<lf>  the laws of California and the United States of America, without regard to<lf>  choice of law or conflict of law principles. The UN Convention on Contracts<lf>  for the International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed.<lf><lf>16. MISCELLANEOUS. If any provision of this EULA is held to be invalid or<lf>  unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions<lf>  will remain in effect and be enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable<lf>  provision were not contained in the EULA. BNEA's failure to act with respect<lf>  to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to<lf>  subsequent or similar breaches.  You may not assign or transfer this EULA or<lf>  your rights, and any attempt to the contrary is void.  This EULA sets forth<lf>  the entire understanding and agreement between BNEA and you with respect to<lf>  the subject matter.<lf><lf>If you have any questions concerning this EULA, you may contact<lf>BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc.'s customer service at<lf>http://www.bandainamcoent.com/company/support.html or at<lf>BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc., 2051 Mission College<lf>Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95054, USA.

VS DIO, Gone to Heaven
[Aura Armor]<lf>DIO, Gone to Heaven is clad in <color red>Aura Armor</color>, so <color red>normal attacks</color> don't do much damage to him. Team up with a partner and perform <color red>Dual Combos and Heat Attacks</color> to break through his armor and deal massive damage. After DIO, Gone to Heaven uses a major technique, his <color red>Aura Armor will temporarily disappear</color>. That's your chance to strike!
[Attacking Allies]<lf>DIO, Gone to Heaven can <color red>overwrite your allies' minds</color> and make them attack you. When one attacks you, <color red>deal a certain amount of damage to them</color> to turn them back to normal. Or, attack DIO, Gone to Heaven when he's <color red>charging his aura</color> in order to prevent the overwrite.
When playing Cheating Poker with Darby, you may choose to cheat whenever you like. The difficulty and rate of success/failure will differ based on your Mental Gauge. Darby may also try to cheat as well. When it's clear that you have the disadvantage, you can try and Bluff in order to turn the tables. You win if Darby loses all of his chips; Darby wins if you lose all of your chips.
[Screen Guide]<lf>1. Mental Gauge: The player whose color covers more of the screen has the advantage.<lf>2. Chip Info: This displays your chip count, Darby's chip count, and how many chips you've bet.<lf>3. Cheating Difficulty: This indicates the difficulty of the button sequence that will appear when you decide to Cheat.<lf>4. Cheating/Bluff Indicator: This appears when it's possible for you to Cheat or Bluff.
[Cheating Poker Flow]<lf>1. At the start, you each pay one chip to play the game.<lf>2. Either raise or call until you've both bet the same amount of chips.<lf>3. Change out as many cards as you want.<lf>4. Either raise or call again until you've both bet the same amount of chips.<lf>5. Reveal your cards. The strongest hand wins.<lf>6. The winner claims all chips that were bet that round.<lf>7. The game ends when one player runs out of chips.
You can do the following things during your turn.<lf>Raise: You can raise your bet by up to 4 chips. Players can use this only once per game.<lf>Call: Continue playing the game with the current bet.<lf>Fold: Drop out of the current game. If you select this, Darby will claim the chips you bet.
Cheating: You may cheat when it's time to switch out cards. Both players may do this twice per game. After three games, both sides receive one Cheating charge. Upon activating Cheating, several buttons will appear on screen. Input them within the time limit to succeed at Cheating and earn a hand capable of beating Darby. Prevent Darby from Cheating to lower his Mental Gauge.
Bluffing: This is only possible when you have less than 3 chips, and allows you to completely turn the tables by reversing the Mental Gauge. As with Cheating, you'll have to input a certain combination of buttons.<lf>Cheating Difficulty: The Cheating Difficulty changes under the following conditions.<lf>1. The difficulty increases if you cheat when your Mental Gauge is low.<lf>2. The difficulty level decreases if you let your next turn come without Cheating, and your Mental Gauge is high.
