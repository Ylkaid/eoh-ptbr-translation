(20310)Cairo, Egypt -1988-
After a long journey, Jotaro Kujo and his allies finally came face to face with their mortal enemy, DIO...
But none of them were any match for the overwhelming power of DIO's Stand.
Finally, just when Jotaro and DIO were the only two left standing,
DIO used Joseph's blood to power himself up.
Oh, this feels goo-oo-ood!
I feel so good I could sing. Hu hu hu hu ha ha ha ha!
It's been a hundred years since I first became immortal.
I've never felt as HIGH as this! HA HA HA HA!!
(Son of a bitch...)
WRYYAAAAA!
Urgh...
Now to finish you, Jotaro!!
Dammit!
Without further ado, it's time for the final strike! This is the absolute final time freeze!
Bring it...on... DIO...
Within these next nine frozen seconds, I'll finish you off once and for all!
Finish who off? That's my line, DIO!
Hmph! MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!!
Asshole!
How do you feel now? DIO...
I've never! EVER! Felt so perfectly wonderful...

Beating the living crap out of you and finishing you off here would only leave a bad aftertaste in my soul!
And yet...
Beating the living crap out of you and finishing you off here would only leave a bad aftertaste in my heart!
How many seconds until your leg heals? Three? Four?
Once it heals, I'm gonna sic Star Platinum on you, so bring it on!
Or, if I was a gunslinger from an old Western, I'd say...
Draw! Let's see who's the faster one!
(H... H... How dare he... make a fool out of ME...)
(But... But! Jotaro... Even though you've made it this far, you're still just a mere human... Heh heh heh...)
(You think like a human does - a human who only lives for a blink of an eye...)
(Worrying about stupid things like bad aftertastes and living a life with no regrets...)
(The way you think is as stupid as rat shit smeared all over a toilet, and now it's going to be the death of you! Heh heh heh heh!)
(I, DIO, possess none of that! All I have is one simple principle... Just one!)
(Win, and seize control! That's it! That alone is my satisfaction!)
(The process... The method...)
Nnnggh!
How's that?! I've blinded you with blood! Victory is mine! Now diiieee!
Oraaaa!
Wha...?!
Gwoaaaahhh?! Whaaaaat?!
Im...Impossible! H...How...How could I, DIO...
I, DIOOOOOOOO...
There's only...one reason you lost...DIO....
Just one simple reason...
You pissed me off.
You think I care about thaaaat?!
DIO / THE WORLD - Total Defeat... RIP
Kakyoin, Iggy and Avdol...
Jotaro overcame the noble sacrifices of his allies and defeated DIO, his fated enemy.
Exposed to the morning sun, DIO's body soon turned to dust and disappeared.
After surviving for 100 years, the evil emperor had finally been overthrown.
Afterwards...
What I need: My Stand.
A friend I can trust.
The souls of at least 36 people who have committed Ultimate Sins.
The 14 Phrases.
Courage.
My decaying Stand will gather up the souls of 36 Sinners, absorb them, and give birth to something new.
The last thing I need is a place.
The Time of Heaven...
Oh Jotaro, there you are!
The hospital contacted me. Looks like Jean Pierre's woken up, so let's go see him!
...
Hm? What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Go to Latitude 28°24' north, Longitude 80 °36' west... And wait for the next New Moon...
Heh heh... I found you, Jotaro Kujo, and your Star Platinum.
It's no wonder the Noble One told me to dispose of him... He possesses a Stand with unrivaled power. But...
He's still no match for our Stands...
Passengers for flight number 92 to Paris should proceed quickly to Gate 18...
Why go back to France, Jean Pierre?
You don't have any family left there, right? Why don't you come and stay with me in New York?
Mr Joestar... I may not have any more family in France, but it's still my homeland.
I have many fond memories attached to my hometown. Wherever my travelling takes me, I always end up back there.
If you ever need me, don't hesitate to call. I'll come running across the entire earth if I have to.
Well, I'll miss you.
...
...
We had our share of troubles, but...I had a really good time.
Traveling together made it fun.
...
I feel the same way...from the bottom of my heart.
Right, I'm off! Listen up, you old curmudgeon, you better not go dying any time soon, you hear me?
You and that heartless grandson of yours! You'd better not forget me!
We'll meet again! Unless you've had enough of me...you blasted fool!
I couldn't forget a character like you even if I wanted to...
Take care now...
...Later!
There they are! At last!
?
Hm?
Heh heh heh. It all makes sense now. Kinda...makes me want to laugh!
You're both so buff...
I knew at first glance that you're both descendants of Mr Joestar!
A friend of yours, Gramps?
No, I don't know who he is.
You're right, though. I am a Joestar... And who might you be?
Ohh, please excuse me. I'm...
Mr Joestar! Jotaro!
Gggghhh!
Jean Pierre?!
What's wrong? Why are you injured?! What's going on?!
I-I have no idea...
Not the slightest...goddamn...idea...
Enemies! They're coming for us!
Huh?
Wh...
...
...
What? Wh-what in the world?
Them! They're the ones! Watch out! They're going to attack!
Magician's Red!
GRRRRR!!
Avdol? Iggy?
I...I thought you were both dead... What in the hell...
I don't know what's going on, but we can't fight here!
There are too many innocent people around. Let's relocate!
What the?! They've already caught up with me?!
The clock is ticking. I need to hurry!
Gimme a break... What's going on, Jean Pierre? What is this?
No clue. When I tried to get on the plane for Paris, they suddenly appeared and came at me.
Urk... They caught up with us...
Want to keep running?
No, let's stay here and take them on.
There's no escape...
Grrrrrrrr!
Fools who dare to bring harm to the Noble One! I, Mohammed Avdol, will burn up every last piece of you!
The Noble One...?
Are you really Avdol? Or...
Step aside, Gramps.
I have no clue what's going on here, but there is one thing I know for sure...
They really are trying to kill us.
Mr Joestar, let me deal with them.
Avdol and Iggy died saving my life. I should be the one to slice up these lousy fakes!
Who the hell are you guys, anyway?
We will exterminate anyone who stands in the way of the Noble One...
Grrrrr...
Yo!
Judging by your face, you're dying to know who I am, so I thought I'd introduce myself...
But on second thought, not just yet!
In the beginning, the world was shrouded in flames.
Gimme a break... Guess I'll have to go all-out with you!
Magician's Red represents beginnings. The flames it controls are the beginning of everything!
Silver Chariot! I'll cleave the air and send those flames right back at you!
These flames, this sand... They both feel like...
Gimme a break... Why did you jackasses have to put us through all that?
Burn into cinders and begone!
Grrrr! Grrrrr!
For now, it doesn't matter who I am! Just concentrate on the battle that's kicking off in front of you!
Ooogh...
Ggh...
Now to find out who you really are.
Indeed. Time to bring out my Hermit Purple!
Hm?!
Wh-What's that light?
Avdol! Iggy!
They disappeared in a flash of light... What in the hell were they?
They are who they appeared to be, Mr Joestar.
I fought with them both, so I'm sure of it. They were the real Avdol and Iggy.
Don't be absurd. There's no way that could be. Although...
Who's there?!
I'm impressed. There aren't many who could fight those two off.
K...Kakyoin!
And you're...N'doul?
Heh heh heh...
Why are you so surprised? It's just the same as with Avdol and Iggy...
N'doul and I both swore our allegiance to the Noble One...
Which means...we must destroy you!
You too, Kakyoin?! What happened?!
Stand back, Jean Pierre. It's my turn now.
I won't let you get away this time. Hermit Purple will make you cough up everything!
Kakyoin teamed up with N'doul!?
I'm coming straight at you. You won't have space to breathe!
Impossible. You'll never get near us.
Heh... I'll pick him off like a fly!
My Hierophant Green...likes to hide in the shadows.
Are you...the real Kakyoin?
He's tracking our sounds so he can attack us!
I can hear you... I know right where you are!
I never imagined a long-distance Stand duo could be this dangerous...
Pfft. If we could only get closer, it'd be a piece of cake...
I told you already...you'll never get near us.
Now there is no one left to stand in our way.
Gramps!
Gffh...
Such...strength...
I swore to devote my life to the Noble One! I can't let myself die yet!
But I'll step down for now... Farewell, Joestars!
Damn it! They got away!
Not quite. I caught Kakyoin...
We'll deal with N'doul later. For now, I'll use Hermit Purple to check out Kakyoin.
Hold it!!
Not another one... Who the hell are you, now?
Wait, you're the guy we met at the airport...
Joseph, old fellow, this is a problem your powers can't solve.
Just leave it to me!
With the power of the Holy Corpse, I'll bring your friend back to normal!
What's that now?
Holy Corpse...?
Uggh... Where am I? Jotaro?
And Mr Joestar... Jean Pierre?
Have you come to your senses now, Kakyoin?
Ah!
I just remembered! DIO! DIO's ability! I figured out what his ability is!
!
You just calm down, Kakyoin. The battle with DIO's over now.
Who are you? How do you know my name?
What did you just do to Kakyoin? What the hell is going on here!?
Wait! Hold it! You need to calm down too.
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to introduce myself.
My name is Robert E.O. Speedwagon. I came here to make a request of you!
Speed...wagon?
That's the name of the founder of the Speedwagon Foundation!
I've got it! You're an amateur conman!
OH MY GOD!
No, Jean Pierre... I can hardly believe it, but I remember now. It really is him...
You look just like that photo I saw of Speedwagon when he was young!
You've seen me before? Good, that should make things quicker.
This is a part of the Holy Corpse.
A holey copse?
To put it simply, it's the mummified dead body of a great man who died a very long time ago.
The Holy Corpse has guided me through a plethora of different eras of history.
As we speak, our world is falling into a truly phenomenal crisis...
Which has given birth to all kinds of anomalies.
Just like what happened to that Kakyoin guy there.
You're saying that Kakyoin and Avdol came back to life because of anomalies?
Wow...
Don't worry about me, Mr Joestar.
My memory cuts off at the point when DIO attacked me and I was flung into a water tank...
But then why did Avdol and I attack Mr Joestar and the others? I want to know the truth...
Kakyoin. Who is the Noble One that you were talking about before?
Is he connected to the crisis that Speedwagon mentioned?
I don't know... I can't remember anything at all...
I'll give it to you straight. I want you to help me gather up the Holy Corpse parts!
There are nine Holy Corpse parts in total!
And they possess bizarre powers...
If we collect the other eight parts, we can build them into the Full Corpse and unleash its true power.
Then, we'll be able to fix all the anomalies and avert the crisis!
At least, I think we will.
You "think" we will?
Truth be told, I don't really know myself.
Since I came into possession of the corpse, I've been hearing voices whispering in my ear.
That's what led me here.
Whoa whoa whoa. Are you sure this guy's all there?
Wait, Jean Pierre. Let's hear him out.
The era I belong in was thrown into total chaos by those anomalies.
But I can't do anything about it by myself!
The Holy Corpse led me here so that I could meet you.
In other words, you must be the ones who are capable of stopping the crisis that threatens our world!
...I think.
Alright, that's it...
I know this is coming out of nowhere, but I'm begging you! Please fight alongside me!
Talk about surreal...
I've been through all kinds of bizarre adventures, but this is really a cut above the rest.
Well, what do you all think?
Gimme a break... It's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
I can't understand a thing he says, and I don't trust a word of it either!
But, he really did bring Kakyoin back to normal...
I trust him. I don't really see any other choice.
Hmm... There's no disputing the fact that Avdol, Iggy and N'doul really did attack us...
Okay, the verdict's in. Listen, up, Mr Speedwagon!
No, that sounds weird... Okay, Speedwagon! We've decided to help you out.
Thank you! What a relief.
Hm? Now what?
Look!
The Holy Corpse is resonating. That means that there's another corpse part nearby!
What?
Seems like there's another corpse part in the vicinity. Let's split up and find it!
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
So, what's this request of yours?
Look!
You've found the Holy Corpse (Body)!
Remember, this part of the corpse chose you. Be sure you don't lose it!
What's that?
It looks like a gap...like a rift made out of light...
These Light Rifts are created by the Holy Corpse parts.
Anyone who steps inside the Light Rifts can travel to a different era.
Right then, off we go! Just follow me!
Heh heh heh.
What's so funny, Jean Pierre?
I was just thinking...
If this goes well, Avdol and Iggy might come back to life! Just thinking about it made me smile...
I didn't expect to go on another journey together so soon...
Me either.
I'll say.
Gimme a break...(20598)
