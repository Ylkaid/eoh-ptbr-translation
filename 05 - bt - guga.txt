(21306)-1938-
Led by the destiny he inherited from his grandfather Jonathan, Joseph encountered the Pillar Men.
The Pillar Men were in search of a mysterious stone known as the "Red Stone of Aja."
If they succeeded in obtaining the stone, the entire world would be at their mercy.
In order to take on these powerful foes, Joseph teamed up with Zeppeli's grandson, Caesar,
and began training under the supervision of Lisa Lisa, a Hamon master.
Where are we this time? An island? I can hear the sound of waves...
This is...Air Supplena Island!
You know this place, Gramps?
Yes. It's where I did my Hamon training, 50 years ago...
Wow, this really takes me back. I might try doing some Hamon breathing...
Kaaaaaaaa...
So you can show us the way around, then?
Of course!
...Or so I'd like to say, but it was a whole 50 years ago. Unfortunately, my memories have gotten a bit blurry...
Gimme a break...
Hm? What's going on over there?
Kaaaaaaaa...
Kaaaaaaaa...
Huh?
What happened, JoJo? Are you worn out already?
No, I see people over there.
What?
I think that guy is... Yes! There's no mistaking him!
That's my old friend Caesar! Caesar Zeppeli!
...
...
(Who's that sweaty little brat?)
(Who's this mangy old fart?)
(Ah! It's me! That must be me!)
(It sure is weird to see your own face from fifty years ago...)
Gramps... You mean that punk over there is you when you were young?
Don't you call me a punk!
What are you whispering about?
Yeah, and who are you guys? This island is private property, y'know.
Caesar... JoJo...
Lisa Lisa, we've found some intruders.
It seems unlikely...but it's possible they might be working with the Pillar Men.
You both have to die! Immediately!
Huh?
Y-You want to kill...us?!
Her Hamon is overflowing with bloodlust!
L-Lisa Lisa! What's come over you?
Gimme a break... Another anomaly?
Hey, Caesar! I'm not sure what's going on, but it looks bad!
That attack just now was serious!
B-But why would Lisa Lisa...
Get ready! ...HUH?!
Heh heh heh heh heh...
Look how fit and healthy you look... Yes, you certainly have matured, Joestar!
What the? What's the German army doing here?
No! It can't be...
Stroheim!
JoJo... I crawled back up from Hell!
But Stroheim got blown to bits in Mexico! How are you here right now?!
They do say that Germany is hiding some crazy medicine and science and preparing for war, but...
Is that how you survived, Stroheim?!
Wroooooong again, JoJo!
What? Really?
I was resurrected thanks to the power of the Noble One, and I'm stronger than ever...
In other words... Forget about humanityyyy! I've surpassed every being that exiiiiists!
Say hello to Stroheim, the Perfect Life Form!
Y...You're not making any sense...
But if Lisa Lisa and Stroheim are teaming up, that means there's something very strange going on here!
Prepare yourself, JoJoooo!
We have no choice, Caesar! Let's fight them!
Nnnngh... You're right.
Lisa Lisa! Stroheim! Let's go!
Lisa Lisa...I'm going to fight back now!
Death to the Hamon amateurs!
You shall praise my perfectioooon!
Prepare to die!
Lisa Lisa! Why are you doing this?!
Goddammit, Stroheim! Is your entire body a machine now?!
German soldierrrrs neverrr kneeeel!
Forgive me, Lisa Lisa!
Does this mean we completed the final test already?
With Hamon skills that poor, you deserve to die!
Even my name is wonderful! "RUDOL VON STROHEIMMM!"

Mmmggh...
Not bad, JoJo. Heh heh... HAH HAH HA!
WAAAH HAH HAH! We will meet again!
Ooogh...
Lisa Lisa! Are you okay?
Caesar, you idiot! If you get too close she'll blast you with her Hamon!
How can you just leave her like this? We have to tend to her!
Out of the way.
What?
Wow...
W-What happened to me?
Master! You've returned to your senses!
Hey you! What did you just do?
We're looking for parts of the Holy Corpse, like this one.
I know that there's one somewhere on this island. I want to find it.
Huh? Hey, I asked you a question!
Urrghh...
Lisa Lisa!
I guess I owe you one for bringing Lisa Lisa back.
But this island is private property. You can't just go wandering around by yourselves.
JoJo! Go with these guys, will you?
I'll take Lisa Lisa back to her room.
I'll help.
No thanks. You don't seem to be our enemies, but I'm still suspicious of you.
Forgive me for this, Master.
C'mon, grandpa! You're in the way. Get back...
Huh?!
(I just felt Hamon! Does this old man really know how to use Hamon...?)
(More importantly... It feels like...)
(I know him from somewhere!)
(No... I know his Hamon!)
JoJo, I'll be back as soon as I've taken Lisa Lisa to her room.
Hey, old man! Just who are you?
I know you're a Hamon user.
But your Hamon is just...like...
You hear that, Gramps? Time to explain.
Why is it always me who has to do the explaining?
Can you think of someone better to do it?
Grrmm...
Okay. I guess I'll start with some introductions.
My name is Joseph Joestar.
WHAAAAT!?
This punk here is Jotaro, my grandson.
...
We've come from an age half a century in the future.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
The future? Seriously? Have you two gone kooky or something?
Yeah... I guess anyone would react that way.
But maybe if I show you this...
You'll believe me when I say that we came here from the future.
Jotaro, get the turtle...
Hey, Speedwagon! Can you come over here for a minute?
Huh? Speedwagon?
You rang?
Gaaaah!
H-H-He came...out of the turtle?!
And that face!
I've seen it before, in Grandma Erina's old pictures!
Hm? Who's this lad?
It's me when I was younger.
I wanted to show him your face to help him understand the situation a bit better.
Wow. He looks just like Mr Joestar!
I'd like to have a chat with him...
But at the moment I'm a bit busy taking care of Mr Joestar so that he can rest up properly.
See ya later, Joseph!
Talk about a one-two punch!! This is freakier than seeing any kind of ghost...
A young Speedwagon!
And then an old man claiming to be "me from the future"! Both standing right in front of my eyes!
Well, what do you say? I know there's no use in hurrying you, but...
...
No, it's okay. I get it.
Feeling your Hamon and seeing Speedwagon has convinced me.
It's pretty hard to believe... But I guess I can't disbelieve it either...
Tell me, though - why are you here? You were saying something about corpses?
That's right. We...
Hm?!
Hey you! What are you doing?
Hmm... No sign of her here...
I heard there was a super hot chick living on this island. I was looking forward to meeting her...
Huh?
I know that face! You're...Hol Horse!
Oh, Jotaro. I'm mighty pleased you remember me.
I'm here with my comrade Centerfold under the Noble One's orders...
Seize the Holy Corpse! And get rid of the lousy bunch who are getting in our way! Those are the orders, see...
Hm. So the other one's hiding?
Just cut the crap and come at me.
Let's take these guys out and reap the rewards, Mr Centerfold!
Hol Horse... Spread more water around!
Aye aye, sir! Here's a shipful for you!
Ready to finish this, Mr Centerfold?
Heh heh... Very well. Bring them to me...
When Mr Centerfold's Hanged Man and my Emperor team up, no one stands a chance!
Ggh!
Geeeyaaaah!
The one with the mirror Stand is over there!
Hey, why are you attacking us? Are you guys collecting the corpse parts too?
Hee hee... You haven't realized? How sad...
It should be obvious why the Noble One would want to eliminate you...
Wait!
Farewell, Jotaro. Farewell, Joestar!
Give my love to the lady of the island. It's a real pity I won't get to meet her...
H-He disappeared just like Stroheim did...
What's wrong, JoJo?
Are you guys our enemies after all?!
No, Caesar. That's not it...
(What should I say? Explaining everything would be such a pain in the ass...)
These guys are guests of mine. It's been so long that I completely forgot them, but they're old friends.
Old friends?
...
JoJo, are you trying to hide something from me?
It appears...this island is deserted...
Although the arena does look interesting...
Huh?
WHAAAAT!?
!
The woman with the Red Stone of Aja...
must be on the next island...
I'm the only one here...
Seems like Kars and Wamuu haven't figured out that the stone is in this area.
You son of a bitch! You've found Lisa Lisa already?!
Esidisi!!
How is he...doing that? It's like he's not human!
Hoh...
I see... So you just arrived as well...
Wamuu!
Hm?
!
Master Esidisi...
OHHH NOOO!
This is bad! Now Wamuu's here! Two Pillar Men at the same time...
(OH! NO! Not only Esidisi but Wamuu as well?!)
Forgive me for interrupting...
But Master Kars has already arrived...
Heh...
Oh! Kars! You too?
Th-Three Pillar Men at once! You've gotta be kidding me... We're in deep shit!
(OH! MY! GOD!)
(Even Kars is here?!)
(What's going on here? This isn't the past as I remember it!)
!
Kars...!
Kars, the stone isn't here. It's on the next island.
Yes, so it would seem...
In that case, let's dispose of this trash and then get moving.
Master Kars, Master Esidisi...
I made a promise in Rome to duel with that JoJo man over there...
Please allow me to fight him!
Wait, Wamuu...
It appears his Hamon skills have improved a fair deal....
Let me play with him a bit first, will you?
...
Y...
No! This won't do!
You're both forgetting what our objective is here: To obtain the Red Stone of Aja! That, and nothing else!
We can just let the vampires deal with them.
Huh? The VAMPIRES?
Sounds good to me. This is a chance to test what we've learned in our training.
Vampires or no vampires, I'll destroy them all at once!
Goddammit! You guys are gonna pay for this!
Don't talk more than necessary. Remember your breathing.
Vampires! Exterminate them!
That's the way, JoJo! You've got a good rhythm going.
Leave it to me! I'll crush them all in no time!
I can do it! My breathing is steady! I'm not even tired!
Yes! I can maintain my Hamon at the perfect level!
I can really sense the fruits of all our hard work...
Our Hamon have gotten stronger!
Let's move out... Tonight, the Red Stone of Aja will be ours!
Nnnnn?!
Just half a month ago, your Hamon abilities were below par...
And yet now you can polish off a whole team of vampires in a matter of minutes. How is that possible?
GRIN...
Wamuu!
I just couldn't hold it back, Master Kars.
...
So be it, Wamuu.
Yes, my master.
I forgive you. Fight with them to your heart's content.
...
As you wish.
Esidisi, you shall fight with him too.
Heh heh heh. Now you're talking.
JoJo and Caesar! I will acknowledge your strength...
Hmph! If you want to fight right now, then I'll take you on!
Let's go, Caesar!
Yeah! We can beat them now!
I, Wamuu, will now consider you to be worthy prey!
You'd better entertain me, you little chickadees!
More, JoJo, more! Is that the limit of your Hamon?!
Shut your mouth! If you really want to feel my Hamon that much, then I'll shower you with it...
Huh? It looks like Wamuu can control wind... And Esidisi can control heat!
Heh heh heh! What's wrong? Try fighting back, why don't you?
I can feel how I've improved since we last fought...
Our Hamon...can reach them!
It was a good fight. I'm satisfied now!
Master Esidisi, you were marvelous...
Wamuu...
I can't believe the both of us together couldn't stop them...
...
Esidisi, Wamuu, that's enough!
You both have a bad habit of enjoying your fights too much...
Sir...
Hmph.
The Red Stone of Aja is moments away. We can't waste any more time here.
Listen up, Hamon users. Next, you shall fight me, Kars.
Now we have to fight YOU?!
Just what I was hoping for!
Let's go, JoJo!! Now we can finish this!
Caesar? Aren't you getting a bit overexcited?
Kars! On my honor as a Zeppeli, I will defeat you!
And what exactly...is a Zeppeli?
Try my special bubbles on for size!
Caesar! You're getting in too close! Draw back a bit!
What's your problem, Caesar? Calm down!
I am calm! Have you gotten scared or something, JoJo?!
Kaaaaars! I'm going to wipe you clean off this earth!
Caesar, what's going on? You don't seem yourself at all...
Is that it? Just as I thought... Esidisi, Wamuu, playtime is over!
Nnnnnggh!
I can't believe you've gotten this strong...
(Oh no...)
(I fought the Pillar Men too, so I know what this means...)
(They still need to learn how to channel their Hamon a little better!)
Nuuu!
!
Lisa Lisa!
I felt something was amiss...
You came to visit us in the middle of the night? How rude...
Hoh! So now all the Hamon warriors are assembled...
...
Kars! Wamuu! Want to play with them one more time?
I see we have no choice. Caesar! JoJo! We need to stop them here!
Yes, master!
(This is bad! The Pillar Men were just testing the waters before. If they get serious...)
(And this turns into a real battle...)
(They'll lose!)
(Oh shit. Lisa Lisa's acting like she's fine, but I don't think she's fully recovered yet.)
(We can't let this battle get out of hand!)
(Hasn't Caesar noticed what's wrong with her?)
Wait! Kars!
Even if you fight here and win,
you still won't be able to get the Red Stone.
What?
(That old man! How does he know about the Red Stone?)
Do you think we're so stupid that we'd actually leave the Red Stone lying around here?
It's hidden away in a special safe.
If we don't send someone to it at every scheduled interval, then a time bomb will blow up the Red Stone!
Enough with the bluffing, you old fool...
It'll only be a small explosion, but more than enough to damage the Red Stone...
Y...
Yeah, yeah, he's right! If we die, then BOOM! BOOM!
Nnnnn...
Lisa Lisa, you still haven't fully recovered from the effects of the anomaly.
In a fight between Hamon users, irregular breathing can be fatal!
...
I'm sorry to dispute what our guest here says, but now is the perfect chance for us to defeat them all!
If we don't beat them now, then when?
Caesar, what's the big rush?
Why are you in such a panic? Calm down and think!
I'm not panicking! This is our chance to finish this!
Ah!
This is our chance to get revenge for our grandfathers, who died because of that Stone Mask!
I'm going to murder every last one of them!
Get revenge? And what the hell do you know about my grandfather, huh?!
Wait, Joseph Joestar. Don't you say another wooord...
This is bullshit. What the hell do people who died 50 years ago have to do with this, you idiot?!
Watch your tongue, JoJo!
You never even met them, and...
SHUDDAP!!!
!
!
Joseph Joestar.
I know you think that you're smarter than other people,
but from where I stand, you're still nothing but a spring chicken.
Say that again, you old geezer!
There is still much about this world you don't know.
If you speak about those things lightly without understanding them properly first, you'll certainly come to regret it!
...
You need to calm down too. No battle can be won through rash action.
This is an issue that concerns my ancestors, the Zeppeli family.
If Kars is here, there's no way that I can let him go without avenging my family.
The feelings you have for your ancestors are very noble ones.
However, you mustn't forget about the people in your family now, and your friends, who feel just the same about you.
If something goes wrong, the survivors will be full of deep regrets. And I think you know exactly how that feels.
...
But it's too late to turn back now.
Hm? That's strange... Are you sure about that?
I thought the promise you made in Rome was to fight in 33 days...
At least, that's what I heard.
Why are you in such a hurry when you've still got another 6 days to spare?
Could it be... Could it be that you're SCARED about how quickly they're growing?
...
...
...
Yeah! Yeah, that's it!
The fight just now proved it to you!
With six more days, Caesar and I...
will get strong enough to completely obliterate all three of you at once!
...
Hmmmm?
Fu... Fu ha ha ha!
So be it. It's a silly taunt, but I'll let you have your way.
For us, six days is no more than the blink of an eye.
Show us how much you can really change in that tiny period.
Esidisi, Wamuu. It's time to go.
Hey, old man. Are you a Hamon user too?
I think I'd like to try you on for size too...
Ha ha ha. You'll get your wish...in six days' time, that is!
(You must be kidding! Hurry up and get out of here! I never want to see your faces again...)
Heh heh heh. I can't wait.
JoJo... Hone your skills! Strengthen yourself!
Until you can no longer resist your urge to kill Wamuu!
Dammit! Those assholes never shut up...
Still, we did manage to get rid of them!
Urrghh...
Are you okay, Lisa Lisa?
Yes...
By the way...who are you?
Me? Hmm, where should I begin...
Well, let's talk about it inside. Jotaro!
This way, Caesar. Oh, and you too, JoJo.
A turtle? What?
Gimme a break...
Hm?
It's resonating... There must be a corpse part somewhere nearby.
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
(Hey... Let me out!)
...
Geez, what's with this thing?
Inside that turtle is a room...filled with people... It makes no sense!
Yeah. I don't know why either. Just grab that corpse part, will you?
Huh? This thing?!
Wh-what's this light?!
Urgh!
You got the Holy Corpse (Ears)!
Got another corpse part...
Gross! It's all dry and flaky!
Hey, take good care of that thing. It's the mummy of some holy saint or something.
What? That's not really ringing any bells...
I know! I just got a great idea!
I'm gonna show it to Caesar and creep him out! Heh heh heh...
So annoying...(21727)
