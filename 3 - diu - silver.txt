(20855)JapanÂ -1999-
In Morioh Town, S City, there lives a high school delinquent named Josuke Higashikata.
With the help of his friends, he took on a fearsome serial killer named Yoshikage Kira
and successfully defeated him.
We're...back in Japan?
This town!
I remember it! At least, I think I do. Could it possibly be...?
What is it, Gramps?
...
Oh, no, nothing at all. Let's get looking for those Holy Corpse parts, shall we?!
?
Huh? What the...
Okuyasu said he's got a cold, but he's obviously just skipping!
I'm gonna go to his house and teach him a lesson!
What are you talking about? We're just going to see how he's doing!
Huh?
Holy crap! Koichi, look at this!
That guy looks exactly like Jotaro!
...
Who the hell is that? By the looks of that uniform, he isn't from around here.
They say that everyone has three doppelgangers... But that one looks a bit too similar...
Hey, Josuke...
Maybe it isn't Jotaro's doppelganger. Maybe it's the real Jotaro!
No way. They look similar, but that guy's way too young.
Are you sure?
Hey!
Y-yes, how may I help you?
I have a question for you... Have you noticed any strange things happening around there?
Strange things? In Morioh Town?
(I-I've no idea what he wants from me, but...)
(Because of all the Stand users here, it's nothing but strangeness 24/7...)
(The fact that I'm talking to Jotaro's doppelganger is strange enough to begin with...)
...
Okuyasu! What are you walking around outside for? I knew you were faking it!
You're gonna pay...
Huh?
You're gonna pay for getting in our way...
The Hand!!
Huh!?
Star Platinum... I stopped time.
Gimme a break... Another Stand User caught in an anomaly?
(W-What was that? Star Platinum The World?!)
O-Okuyasu? What are you doing?!
I see. This is what you could do when you were at your peak...in 1988.
!
Rohan...?
It's truly fascinating. Before I do away with you, I think I'll make you into a book and read it.
Of course, that goes for you too, Koichi and Josuke.
Hey, Rohan! Cut the crap! You're not making any sense, man!
You are all obstacles in the path of the Noble One. Therefore...
I'm going to take you all out...
Okuyasu! Rohan!
Looks like they're serious. Koichi! Use your Stand to protect yourself!
We have no choice. Let's do this!
Why? Why do we have to fight Okuyasu and Rohan?
Okuyasu Nijimura's The Hand is going to wipe you all out!
I'll write it in right now. You will all "die here..."
Bring it on, losers!
Okuyasu! Cut it out before I lose my temper!
Resistance is futile, Koichi...
What has gotten into you two?
A-are you two...o-okay?
Don't worry, Koichi. I'll fix them both right up.
Say goodbye, Josuke Higashikata and Koichi Hirose!
I'm gonna swipe you right out of this world!

Urghie...
Ggh... How pathetic... I think it's time I took my leave...
Wait up. I'm not finished yet.
Ah!
Waaah!
Urrrgggh... You prick!
Okuyasu! Stop right there!
Argh... Koichi? Wh-What's going on?
R-Rohan? A-Are you okay now?
Take care of him for me.
I'm going after the one who ran. He went that way, right?
Yes! Thank you so much, Jotaro! Please bring Okuyasu back to normal too!
...
Hey...how do you know my name?
Huh? Oh, I guess it just slipped out...
Are you really Jotaro?!
B-But why do you look as young as a high school student?!
What do you mean...young?
...
!
Oh, Jotaro...
Japan is bigger than I thought. I ended up getting lost! Hah hah hah...
Gramps. I just met up with some guys who've met us in the future.
This Morioh Town is over ten years further in the future than the era we came from.
Hm?
Oh... You're that guy from before...
Josuke Higashikata... Koichi told me your name.
FLINCH!
Where did your pal Okuyasu go?
I dunno. I chased him back here, but...
His body kinda flashed, then vanished...
...
Hey, you used your Stand to stop time back there, right?
Are you...
Jotaro Kujo?
Yeah.
Whoaaa! No way!
...Hm?
What the?!
Th-That's... Harvest!
!
What are all those tiny things?!
But I thought Shigechi was dead!
W-Wait!
Chase down Harvest!
Shee shee! That was the perfect lure!
My Harvest is invincible! I'm 'unna beat you all up!
Th-This can't be happening! Shigechi?!
Heh heh heh heh heh. I'm gonna look so cool when I kill you!
Urk! Y-you're... Akira Otoishi!
What are Shigechi and Otoishi doing together?!
They may look like your friends, but don't let your guard down. As of now...they're enemies!
I'm 'unna smash you into splithereens!
Get ready, guys!
This is real rock!
Let it throttle your soul!
My Harvest is really, really strooong!
No one can beat my Harvest!
Shee shee shee! Now the Noble One will give me lots of compliments!
I finally expressed...my heart! And the scream of my soul!
Aieeee! Y-You're really strong...
I-I'm getting outta here!
Shigechi, wait! Hey, Otoishi! Get back here, you asshole!
They're gone... It's just like with Okuyasu...
Jotaro, you have to tell me what's going on here.
What happened to Okuyasu and Rohan?
Why is Shigechi alive again? Why are you young again?
...
Explaining is such a pain in the ass...
Gramps, take it away.
What?
Get in the turtle and explain, will you?
M-Meee!?
I can't just perform at a moment's notice like that... I-I need to make the proper preparations...
I hate reptiles. There's no way I'm going near that thing.
...
Shut your mouth and get your ass over there!
Waah! The young Jotaro is scary!
I-I can't...I really c-can't...
Gimme a break...
I still haven't seen another Light Rift yet...
Does that mean there's still something else we have to do in this era?
Hm?
Jotaro!
Koichi. And Rohan, was it?
I see! Yes, amazing!
Yes, if I had to draw a picture of what I imagined Jotaro had looked like ten years ago, it might look exactly like him!
Would you mind if I sketched you, Mr Jotaro?
I know that I'm older than you now, but it feels weird for me not to call you that...
...
Did you forget what you just did to me?
And you also mentioned the Noble One...
Yes, so I heard. Koichi told me I was saying some strange things.
But I don't remember anything now. I have no idea what that was all about.
It's like there's a mist in my head that's preventing me from remembering anything.
(Sounds just like Kakyoin... They can't remember anything that happened while the anomaly was affecting them...)
Koichi...
Oh, Yukako!?
Here you are! It sure took me a while to find you...
You really made me waste a lot of time! I'm going to rip you all to shreds!
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
I see. So that's what an anomaly looks like. Perhaps I'll observe this for a bit...
I'm going to crush you, Koichi!
Yukako Yamagishi... I used to respect how much you adored Koichi...
Yukako! Snap out of it!
Yukako... What happened to you?
Koichi! You need to die! For me!
Yukako! Please, just listen a minute!
No! You're the one who has to listen to what I say!
It seems like her emotions have gotten out of control...or perhaps "distorted" is the better word?
Yukako! Why are you doing this?! What's happened to our town?!
I love you... So I'll make sure that your death is as painless as possible...
Sounds like he knows the 1988 me...
Just you wait...Koichi...
I'm going to smush you if it's the last thing I do!
Yukakooo!
What happened to you?! It's like you've gone back to your old self...
All that abusive language...and attacking me...
Really? I don't really see much of a change...
Rohan! That's mean!
Hm?
Hyahahahaha hya hya hya!
You're...Enyaba!
Ohhh, I can't tell you how pleased I am! So delighted to see you...Jotaro...
Now I'll be able to eliminate you with my own two hands, you despicable wreeetch!
Who's that old lady?
She's a Stand user who can control people's bodies with mist.
Looks like she's brought a bunch of dead bodies along with her...
D-Dead b-b-bodies?
Kweeeeeehhhh!!
Go get them!
Keh keh keh keh keh keh keh!
If that's all you can manage, then you'll never defeat Justice! Heeeee hee hee hee hee!
It's no use resisting! Kyah kyah keh keeeh!
The Noble One is justice itself! Therefore, I am bound to win!
Justice always wins out in the end!
Gghkeekeekeeeee!
Curse you, Jotaro! Why must you always stand in my way?!
You're all no more than specks of dust in the face of the Noble One...
Enough, you old bag! Who's this Noble One you keep going on about?
You'll meet him soon enough. In your final houuuuur!
Tch....
Okay. Let's leave all the details and crap for later.
We're traveling around looking for parts of something called a Holy Corpse.
It'd be a big help if you'd lend us a hand.
But of course! There's no way I'd miss out on such an amusing spectacle.
If it will help bring Okuyasu and Yukako back to normal, then you can count me in too!
(Okay! Don't get so worried!)
Where's that voice coming from?
(This is the second time now! What does it matter what I call her? Mom, old bag, what's the damn difference?)
(Enough already, man!)
?
(I'm going out for a breath of air. Let's just try and get along, okay, Macho Gramps?)
(M-Macho Gramps?)
Huh? Josuke came out of the turtle?!
Oh! Koichi and Rohan!
This turtle is pretty cool! The inside is like a room in a spaceship! It's killer!
Go on, try it out!
A spaceship? Inside that filthy turtle?
Waaahhh!!
Ahh! Rohan!
Hm?!
What is it?
The corpse is resonating... Looks like there's a Holy Corpse part somewhere nearby!
Find the Holy Corpse part! Look out for a glowing object somewhere in the stage.
Whaaat? You don't even know that much? You rotten little pissant!!
The Noble One is a king among kings! The one who is fit to control the entire world!
If you took him on, you'd be overwritten in a second and disappear forever...
"Overwritten"...?
Not that you'd understand what that means... Keh keh keh keh keh!
Still, there's no need for you to hurry... You'll meet him in due time...
Overwritten? What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Just who could the Noble One be?
Someone that Enyaba and N'doul would pledge their allegiance to...
No... It couldn't be...
Jotaro, what's that weird light?
It's...
Gah! A mummy?!
You got the Holy Corpse (Left Arm)!
It's so dry and flaky... Eww, it gives me the creeps!
Hey, be careful. That's your part of the Holy Corpse right there.
Yeah, I did hear about that inside the turtle...
There are nine parts in total...and we have to collect them...and this is the fourth part, right?
Yeah.
Hey, it flashed!
I'm going to show it to Rohan and creep him out.
Gimme a break...
Hey, Jotaro!
I found something cool inside the turtle.
Something cool?
This camera.
If we use this camera with Mr Joestar's Hermit Purple...
We should be able to reveal the one behind all this in a photograph!
Yes! Time to find out who the ringleader is!
Here goes...
Hermit Purple!
!
Ahh!
N...No! It can't be!
D...DIO?!
That's crazy! It can't be DIO... There's no way!
Mr Joestar. Are you sure you didn't put too much power into your Stand?
No...
Gramps. Your Stand never makes mistakes.
I've been wondering about it for a while...
There's only one person who N'doul and Enyaba would pledge allegiance to, and that's DIO.
But we turned him into dust ourselves!
Just look at me. I'm supposed to be dead as well...
Nngh...
You're right... The same goes for Cool Ice...
The only man he serves is DIO...
I don't know how,
but that bastard DIO is back alive, and he's pulling the strings from the shadows...
At least, that's what we should assume for now...
I'm going to step back inside the turtle for a bit.(21135)
